1  - [CELLPHONE RINGS.]
- [WATER RUNNING.]
AXL: Someone get my phone!  [MUFFLED.]
We're not getting your phone.
I know I said not to touch my phone, but touch my phone!  Why can't you get it?!  I'm in the shower!  Come on, it might be important.
It might be one of the people I sent my rÃ©sumÃ© to!  Then you should definitely get it.
AXL: If I get a job, I'll be moving out.
Axl Heck's phone.
How may I help you?  And whom may I say is calling?  [WATER STOPS, CURTAIN SLIDES.]
One moment, please,  Mr.
McCollum.
Here, here, here.
Hello, this is Axl Heck.
Business is my business.
- [LAUGHS.]
Yeah.
Oh - [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES.]
Knock, knock!  Sorry to barge in, but we have big news, and it just couldn't wait!  I'm sorry, we're not interrupting dinner, are we?  No, we're almost done.
Anyway, we didn't know if you saw,  so we thought we'd be  the first ones to tell you.
Orson made the list  of the top 200  most livable cities!  [GASPS.]
In America?  No, Indiana!  Oh, my God! What number were we ranked?  200.
It's the first time we made the list!  It's right here in Distinctly Indiana Magazine.
Looks like we bumped Porterdale  off the list from last year.
You know, they had that big kerfuffle  about the diving board  - at the municipal pool.
- Hmm.
Well, I think Orson deserves it.
The people here  are just really friendly.
I think it's dumb.
Not everybody.
The whole thing's just a big money-maker.
They just want the people in those 200 towns  who never buy the magazine to buy the magazine.
I bought four!  Well, it's too late now,  'cause Orson's goin' "200" crazy!  We're gonna incorporate the whole thing  into the cow rededication ceremony  200 balloons, 200 desserts,  200 coupons of goods and services from local vendors  that will go into a gift basket  to be awarded to the 200th visitor  who crosses the city line that day!  Wait, 200 balloon?!  That's like two bags' worth!  Yeah, it's a big deal.
Can I tell Axl? I wanna tell Axl!  Axl! Axl!  Orson got voted the 200th most livable city  not in America, but in Indiana  and there's gonna be a huge celebration  and two bags of balloons!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got bigger news.
Jackson Plumbing Supply liked my rÃ©sumÃ©,  and they want me to interview with a Human Resources person  - for a position in sales.
- Really?  Yeah, they said they're gonna call my assistant tomorrow to set it up.
Your assistant? You don't have a Ohh!  - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no! - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!  Sue, come on! Please!  Be my assistant, my assistant sister my assist-erant.
[SIGHS.]
Fine.
But only this once,  and I want to be senior assist-erant.
Done.
Okay.
[SCHOOL BELL RINGS.]
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS.]
Hello, Cindy.
It's me Brick.
I know.
I recognize your voice.
And your face.
Listen, you may have heard  I had a little dalliance  with the new girl, Lilah.
Anyway, she got some notes  containing some pretty disturbing threats,  and, well  might one dare to dream that they were from you?  They were.
Really?  That's great!  I was hoping you still had feelings for me,  'cause I have feelings for you!  My passion does burn bright for you, Brick.
[SIGHS.]
What a relief.
I'm so glad we're back together.
Slow your roll.
Breaking up with me like you did was very cowardly.
So, in order to win me back,  you have to perform three acts of bravery.
"Three acts of bravery"?  Yep, and I have to have them done  by the cow rededication ceremony.
So, I jotted down a few ideas on the bus,  and I want to run 'em by you guys.
Rank them one to five,  with five being the bravest.
Brick, this Frugal Hoosier chicken's on the clock here.
First one foiling a bank robbery.
Five for bravery,  one for how the hell are you gonna make that happen?  Hmm.
Walking through a hail of gunfire like Wonder Woman?  Please don't dress like Wonder Woman.
Holding in my poop all day?  Solid three.
Hmm.
How upset would you be if I set fire to the house  if I was reasonably sure I could put it out?  [SIGHS.]
Could you make it look like an accident?  Mm.
Hey, Mike.
Hey.
Hey, did you hear about Orson being 200th  - in the state of Indiana? - Mm.
I think what put 'em over the top  is when Fountains hired that chef  from the Terre Haute Correctional Facility.
That guy's cooking,  you can lock me up, throw away the key.
Huh.
[CHUCKLES.]
Hey, listen, I wanted to let you know  that Paula's not gonna be at the cow rededication.
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah, we kinda hit a little bump.
Well, it was a bigger bump, I guess.
It's, uh We're We're separated.
Oh.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah.
I mean, it's gonna be fine.
Paula and I both wanted it.
She thought I watched too much sports.
And I thought she changed  ever since she started painting landscapes.
Well, seems like you're handling it well.
Yeah, well, I mean, you know,  we're not the f-first people this has happened to.
Yeah.
All right, then.
Yeah.
I'm not gonna lie to you It's tough, you know?  It's just not the way  you thought your life was gonna go.
You know, a lot of questions ahead.
I mean, wh-what do we do at Christmas?  Oh, God! [SOBS.]
Ugh.
Okay boss.
The HR guy at Jackson Plumbing Supply  has your number.
He'll call to FaceTime you.
All you have to do is pick up.
All right? Okay, great.
Here's a list of other people I sent my rÃ©sumÃ© to,  if you could just follow up with them  and make sure they got it?  Axl, no!  I helped you out once, but I am done.
You're on your own.
Whoa! Hey! Come on, Sue.
Don't you get it?  When they thought I had an assistant,  they set up the meeting.
I mean, think about it.
Who are you gonna call back  the guy who makes 25 cents over minimum wage at Spudsy's  or the guy who has an assistant?  [GASPS.]
You make 25 cents over minimum wage?  See? The world's unfair, Sue.
That's why you got to take every advantage you can get.
Axl, no!  I'm sorry, but I'm not lying for you.
At Lexie's lake house, her mom made us daiquiris,  and even though I'm not 21 yet,  I had a little sip and I liked it!  I can't afford to have anything else go against me  in the eyes of the Lord.
Okay, well, think about it this way.
What if, for helping your brother out,  when you get to Heaven,  they give you a sweet angel job.
You mean like taking care of pets  whose owners haven't arrived yet?  Yep, they're gonna let you right in.
That is, if they recognize you without a head.
Ohh! Axl!  I told you to stop making jokes about freezing my head!  I'm sorry.
I just can't help myself.
Okay, I'll tell you what.
I'll help you out.
But, if I do, you can never make  another head-freezing joke again ever.
Done, done.
I promise.
No more head-freezing jokes for the rest of your life.
Okay.
But once you're dead, all bets are off and so is your head.
- Axl! - Last one, I promise.
- [CHATTER OVER TELEVISION.]
- Okay, we got to get serious  about this time-capsule thing.
- [TELEVISION SHUTS OFF.]
- I mean, they're putting them  in the base of the cow in two days,  and I got nothin'.
Nancy even gave me an extra month,  and I still blew it.
What is the matter with me?  That's not a list we want to attack right before bed.
No, I'm serious.
What is the matter with my brain  that I can't remember anything anymore?  I need to be tested.
[BRUSHING TEETH.]
Oh, hey.
Uh, Bill and Paula are separated.
Wait, what?!  Seriously?  Why did you let me yap on about my brain  when you were sitting on a story like that?  Start talking, mister.
Uh, well, he says they're having problems.
Apparently, she's on him about watching too much sports.
Well, you know what, she's not wrong.
He does watch a lot of sports.
No more than the next guy.
Besides, Paula should appreciate the extra time  to do her little landscape paintings.
Her "little landscape paintings"?  What does that mean?  I'm just saying, maybe she's, uh, distracted  and not attending to his needs.
"Attending to his needs"?!  Where'd you get that from, the '50s?  What, she's not allowed to paint?  Wait, why are we having their fight?  [SIGHS.]
You're right, you're right.
Ugh.
But I just feel so bad for them.
Are they getting divorced?  I don't know.
You'd have to ask Bill.
Well, why didn't you ask Bill?  He started crying, so I came inside.
Mike! You can't do that.
He obviously sought you out  because he needed your support,  and you just come inside?  Okay, I'm gonna call Paula and see how she's doing,  but you need to reach out again to Bill.
He needs you.
Hearing a lot of sympathy for Bill here.
- [BRUSHING TEETH.]
- What about me?  I had a friend cry in front of me today.
FRANKIE: So, Brick, realizing he didn't have the legs  to pull off a Wonder Woman costume,  performed what he hoped would be his first act of bravery.
My fair lady, I bring you the mop  of the crabby afternoon janitor.
Good.
I needed a mop.
How'd you get it?  Wit, skill, cunning and $5.
Hmm.
I'll allow it.
That's one.
[SPORTS CHATTER OVER TELEVISION.]
Hey, thanks for having me over.
Yeah, well, I wanted to make sure that you're okay,  'cause we didn't get a chance to finish talking last time,  'cause I had to come in for the thing.
Yeah.
No, I'm good.
I'm good.
- Good.
- Yeah.
[SIGHS.]
You know, nights are the hardest.
Paula's been pulling away for quite some time.
You know what a game's good for?  Getting your mind off of things that are bothering you.
[CHATTER CONTINUES.]
You got a good one, Mike.
I mean, Frankie's not like other women, you know?  Every time I come over, she likes to talk.
Hmm.
Well, she does like to talk.
Yeah, but not just small talk, you know?  She's She connects.
She's funny.
She's so funny.
Yeah, she can be pretty funny.
Mm.
Totally.
You know, people our age are starting to wind down,  not Frankie.
She's so full of life.
Yeah, I guess she is.
I just appreciate there's no games.
You know, you know where you stand.
I had to find out my wife was unhappy  from a subpoena server.
That was not easy.
I mean, Frankie    Okay, Cindy.
I'm here in front of the Glossners' house.
That's right the Glossners' house.
Pretty brave, huh?  [YELPS.]
Oh.
That was a leaf.
Anyway, I know you're convinced  that the Glossners stole your backup safari hat,  so I, Brick Heck, am going to get it back.
I-I waited until everyone was out of the house.
It's not breaking and entering,  because, well,  all the windows are already broken.
All right, here we go.
[DOG GROWLS.]
Good boy.
[DOG SNARLS.]
Good boy?  [VICIOUS BARKING.]
Good boyyyyyyyyy!  [BARKING CONTINUES.]
I'm sorry I wasn't able to recover your hat.
However, I did sustain  a rather nasty-looking scrape on my arm  that I did not seek medical attention for.
That looks infected.
Okay.
That's two.
- [EXHALES HEAVILY.]
- [SCHOOL BELL RINGS.]
123, 124  What are you doing?  Nothing.
Just looking at you.
Why? Is there something on my face?  Nope.
Just looking.
[SIGHS.]
[SCOFFS.]
Seriously, what is with you?  You're like one of those creepy paintings  where the eyes follow you.
It's just  I realize I'm a lucky man.
I'm lucky to have you.
Okay, now you're being super weird.
What?  Can't I just appreciate you?  Can't I tell you that I think you're neat?  [SCOFFS.]
- [GRUNTS.]
Sue! - [CELLPHONE RINGING.]
Ow! It's Jackson's Plumbing Supply!  - [GASPS.]
- [EXHALES.]
Axl Heck's line.
Hi, this is Vance McCollum from Jackson Plumbing Supply.
I'm looking to speak to Axl Heck.
One moment, please.
Hey, Vance! It's Axl.
Axl, I've got some good news for you.
Gus, the president of the company,  would like you to come in and meet with him in person.
So, we were hoping you could come by tomorrow at 2:00.
Yes!  [CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY.]
Sorry.
[DEEP VOICE.]
Yes.
Great.
We'll see you tomorrow at 2:00, then.
[SQUEALS, LAUGHS.]
I just wanted to say,  you two, you're great kids,  and I don't say that enough.
DEBBIE: And this is for Orson's 200th visitor today.
What a great gift basket, right Deb?  Such a great gift basket, Court.
So, what's in it?  Well, we've got a happy hour coupon  from T.
J.
Schnauzer's,  a free cleaning from Smile Superstars  upper teeth only.
Ooh, and don't forget the free toddler cheer class  from mine and Deb's new store, Sis-Boom-Buy!  [GIGGLES.]
We sell tiny cheer outfits for babies,  because the sooner you start them cheering,  the better chance they have of making varsity!  Yeah!  Now let's check in with Ron Donahue  and see how close we are to finding a winner.
TOGETHER: Where are we at, Ron?  177!  It was a Kentucky license plate, you guys.
- That's exciting! - [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
But it's it's a real job.
I'd get to use my degree, so  [CHUCKLES.]
You know, if they hire me,  I might actually have to learn how to tie one of these.
- [CHUCKLES.]
- [ENGINE SHUTS OFF.]
Okay, we're here.
Thanks for dropping me off.
They think I have an assistant,  so if I showed up in a Winnebago,  that might be a bit of a red flag.
[BOTH CHUCKLE.]
Well, go get 'em.
[EXHALES HEAVILY.]
That's the building, Axl.
- Yep.
- So go in.
- I can't.
- What?  I can't.
I'm freaking out, Sue.
- I can't do it.
- Sure, you can.
Nope, mnh-mnh.
No, no, I'm not doing it.
I'm not getting out.
If they want to interview me,  they can come out here to the car.
- [BREATHES SHAKILY.]
- Okay, Axl.
You listen to me.
You are on the edge  of your first step into adulthood.
If you don't go into that building right now,  you'll regret it for the rest of your life!  - Tell it my legs.
- Get out!  - No! - Go!  No! And if I don't get out, I can't not get it!  - I'm not letting you do this, Axl.
- No!  I am not letting you blow this!  - I can't! - [GRUNTS.]
I can't!  Sue, come on! Please, no!  You are going in there, and you are getting that job!  I miss my old hair, Sue.
My neck feels cold.
It's weird.
Come on! Come on!  Oh, this is very insubordinate behavior!  I'm your boss, for God's sake!  [GRUNTING.]
No, you don't!  Hi.
Axl Heck.
So nice to meet you.
I'm here for my 2:00 appointment.
So, while Sue may not have wanted  to be his "official" assistant,  she was there for Axl when he needed assistance the most.
- [MARCHING BAND MUSIC PLAYS.]
- Okay.
We're just minutes away  from the big unveiling.
We've sealed every family's time capsule  in the base of the cow.
But, first, let's check back in on our visitor count.
You know him, you love him I know I do.
Ron Donahue! Ron!  [INDISTINCT SHOUTING.]
183!  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
This is thrilling, isn't it, folks?  Mike, I forgot to do the time capsule again.
Why can't I remember stuff anymore?  I'm such an idiot.
No, you're not.
You're wonderful.
Okay, seriously, you're scaring me.
[GASPS.]
Hey!  Hey, how'd it go?  Yeah, yeah, what do you think?  What's your feeling?  I'm feeling like I got it.
Wait.
You feel like you got it,  or you got it?  No, I got it! I got the job!  - Oh! That's great! - Hey.
- Yeah.
- Aww.
Axl just needed a little push.
Eh.
You are looking at Jackson Plumbing Supply's  newest junior sales rep for the tri-state area.
Ooh! Which states?  I don't know, but there's tri of them.
Cindy, I'm sorry.
I choked.
I couldn't come up with a third act of bravery,  so I guess I blew it.
Again.
I never should have broken up with you in the first place.
It's the dumbest thing I've ever done.
Three.
What?  That's the third act of bravery.
It takes a brave man to admit he was wrong.
That's all I was looking for.
Really?  Wait, so this is it?  We're really back together as a couple?  Yes.
So should we kiss?  Sure.
Okay, I'll see you around.
All right.
Attention, Orsonites!  We're lucky to have one of our own here  to express what this town means to us.
He's the one that paid  for the refurbishment of our beloved cow.
He's been elected mayor three times,    [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
Look at this crowd size!  Ha! Ha! What a turnout!  Well, let me tell you what I love about Orson, Indiana.
It's a wonderful place  to buy a car.
In fact, we've got a special all weekend  buy a car at twice the price,  and get the second half off.
Okay, let's get this thing done and go home.
And now, I give you the new and improved  Orson Cow.
[CROWD CHEERING.]
[CROWD GASPS.]
So come on down to Ehlert Motors.
Free coffee!  Just leave a dollar in the cup, hmm?  [LIGHT APPLAUSE, BOOING.]
Um, o-o-okay, well, if anybody else wanted  to talk about our town or  I'll do it.
[SCATTERED MURMURING.]
[SIGHS.]
Hi.
Mike Heck.
Uh, born and raised in Orson.
Uh, listen, when I first heard  about this whole, um, 200th thing,  I thought it was dumb.
But the more I thought about it  the more I thought about it  I started to think maybe it isn't such a bad idea.
'Cause this town deserves to be noticed.
But not by some magazine, by us.
Now, I'm a guy who gets up  and puts on the same thing every day  a plaid shirt and jeans  just so I don't have to think about it.
And we all do that we get up, we go to work, we make dinner,  put the kids to bed, and we forget  how lucky we are, how fortunate we are  to live in a town where,  uh, Maricela stands out in front of her store with a plate,  asking if you want to try a butter cookie.
Or Or Or Joe at the stereo store  Well, that's what they called it when I was growing up.
You go in there, he always says hi,  you ask him how his day's going, he always says, "Great.
"  Or how 'bout Lee?  She's the She's the heart and soul of this town.
I think she was here when it was founded.
[LIGHT APPLAUSE.]
And Bill When my roof was leaking,  Bill came over and helped me patch it,  and he left his hammer at my house.
So I returned it to him,  but he said, "It's not even my hammer.
"  Somebody else had left it at his house  when we were all there fixing the fence.
So, that's why, yesterday,  I put that hammer in our family's time capsule.
'Cause I think people in the future should know  that this is a town where people help each other out.
'Cause you do for family.
And that's what we are.
So, you know, uh,  we're we're, uh we're lucky.
We're really lucky.
Uh okay.
I guess that's all I got.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
[MOUTHS.]
All right, Mike.
RON: This is not a drill!  Car 200 is approaching!  [CROWD "OOHS".]
Stop! Stop! This is for you!  Welcome to Orson!  You're our 200th visitor  [TIRES SCREECH, THUD.]
[CROWD GASPS.]
- Honey! Oh, my God! - You okay?  - You all right? - Oh, sweetie!  Don't worry.
Turned out Ron was okay.
The Orson's Best gift basket cushioned the blow.
And the point is, we were all there for him.
[CHATTER OVER TELEVISION.]
I still can't get over what an amazing speech that was.
Who knew you had it in you?  See, you should talk more.
Every so often, I have something to say,  and I say it.
Yeah, I kinda noticed that you've been really loving  towards me and the kids lately.
Disturbingly loving.
I don't know,  I think the Bill and Paula thing  sorta shook me up.
Me, too.
Who'd have thought?  God, I guess we're lucky we found each other.
We're soulmates, right? One in a million.
I don't know about that.
What?  I mean, I'm glad it worked out,  but if I hadn't met you,  I'm sure I would've found someone.
Mike!  What?  There's millions of people in the world.
Are you saying I wouldn't have found one?  I'm not hideous.
Yes, and then you wouldn't have our kids.
Yeah, but I would have other kids that I loved.
I would love whatever kids I had.
[SCOFFS.]
I can't believe you.
Even this whole town thing.
I mean, yeah, Orson's great and all,  but if I had lived somewhere else,  I'm sure I would've found a lot of things to like  about that place, too.
There's hundreds of thousands of towns across America.
It's a big place, Frankie.
[CHATTER CONTINUES.]
Aww.
[SIGHS.]
