1  So, what do you think?  Think you're a few years off.
Well, I think it's cute,  and I think you're jealous because Sue invited me up  to celebrate her 21st birthday  and you had to trick Axl  into celebrating his with you.
I didn't trick him.
And don't get too big a head there.
Didn't she choose you just 'cause  her real friends are out of town?  I'm fun, Mike.
I'm the fun parent, and Sue knows it,  and we are gonna party like it's 1999.
You were 33 with two kids in '99.
Oh, hey, do you know where the blue bag is?  Aha! Whoo! Got it.
That's the blue bag?  I thought the blue bag was yellow.
The blue bag was yellow, and now the blue bag is orange.
Try to keep up.
Oh, good, the blue bag.
Unh-unh.
Blue bag is coming with me.
What? But you're only going 40 minutes.
It'll take Dad and me at least an hour and a half  to get to the Planet Nowhere convention.
[GROANS.]
You still want to do that?  Uh, yeah?  I'm just saying,  it seems like you kind of just did it with Sue.
That was three years ago,  and this time they're taking over a whole abandoned mall.
Now, we're gonna need to lay a little groundwork for you  as a Nowhere newbie.
Yes, I ordered you the badge, but don't worry,  I'll catch you up on the drive.
- [DOOR OPENS.]
- AXL: Hey!  Look who's here.
- Hey! - Hey!  Brickster, lookin' sharp.
And Mrs.
Heck.
Or should I say [BRITISH ACCENT.]
Your Majesty?  So, old Kenny's getting married, huh?  [NORMAL VOICE.]
Crazy, right?  Hitchin' up with some girl  he met on a train platform in Amsterdam.
Yep.
Their avatars fell in love, and then they did.
We haven't even met her yet.
Sweet! The blue bag!  Oh, gross! Who put fruit in here?  I did, because I'm taking the blue bag.
What? No.
No, no, no.
Kenny's wedding is in Ohio,  and the fridge in the 'Bago is busted.
Well, to be fair,  everything in the 'Bago's busted.
Ooh, I told Sue I would be there by 2:00.
Okay, anybody got any birthday cards  or presents I should take up to Sue?  That's what I thought.
All right.
We got a long drive ahead of us,  so we might as well hit the road.
Have fun at Planet Loser.
[SIGHS.]
The sooner we start,  the sooner we finish.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS.]
Unh-unh, we're not doing this.
What? Why not?  'Cause we just waited an hour in line  to see that rock guy.
We're not waiting in another  whole, big line again.
Uh, I believe you're talking about Lord Alyzium.
He's not a rock, he's a mineral.
From where I stood,  he was mostly Styrofoam.
No offense, Dad, but I don't think  you're embracing the spirit of this convention.
I promise you, this one's gonna be worth it.
I didn't want to spoil it for you,  but they have a live Menenjula Twin Habitat.
I don't care if they have  a young Angie Dickinson habitat.
I'm not waiting in this line.
[CELLPHONE CHIMES.]
"Why are you being mean to Brick?  Just wait in line.
"  Did you just text your mom?  Silligans cannot lie.
Well, they can, but then their arms will find off.
Look, I'm the one that brought you out here.
If you got a problem with something,  take it up with me, don't text your mom.
Come on, the line to poke that jellyfish thingy  was wide-open.
Let's go.
Excuse me.
Man, it is so weird, Kenny getting married.
Yeah, I know.
How are we old enough  to have a friend getting married?  Seems like just yesterday,  the three of us were living in this thing.
Because it was just yesterday.
I mean, we practically just graduated.
We're still kids!  How can anyone be getting married?  It's so grown-up.
Is Kenny a grown-up?  Are we grown-ups?  No, we can't be grown-ups.
I still have to date at least one more crazy chick  before I settle down.
Hey, you're closer to being a grown-up than I am.
At least you got your own place.
Would a grown-up still sleep with a night light?  I tell people it's a fancy smoke detector.
I don't even pay my taxes yet.
Well, you should.
Last week, a cartoon made me cry.
I still drink juice boxes.
I still use Batman toothpaste.
[SIGHS.]
Yeah, we're not grown-up yet.
Yeah.
Ooh, Chuck E.
Cheese.
Oh! Why, hello, bartender.
I would like to order some alcohol, please.
And don't worry, it's legal.
You don't have to trust the sash.
Oh!  Wow.
Happy birthday, Miss Sue Sue Heck.
I suppose you're gonna want to see mine.
Ah, my mom makes that joke, too.
All right, first round's on the house  for the birthday girl.
What will it be?  Ohh, I don't know.
They all look so good.
I should've made a binder for this.
Okay, I don't know.
Let's have [GASPS.]
something with an umbrella.
Mm.
No, with fruit.
No! With fire.
Listen, since it's your 21st,  why don't I whip you up something special,  and you can let me know what you think?  - Ah! - Ooh!  Okay.
All right.
[CLEARS THROAT.]
So, you're gonna want to pace yourself.
We have all night.
And the most important thing  is not to drink on an empty stomach.
That means we're gonna want to layer.
We need to make a nice, cozy bed of absorbent food layers  for the booze to rest on.
Got it.
Oh, and don't let me forget  It's a big thing here that on your 21st birthday,  everybody kisses the East Indy dragon statue.
It's one of our oldest traditions,  dating back to the '80s,  so, obvi, I got to do it.
- [BOTH CHUCKLE.]
- Enjoy, ladies.
- Ah! - Mmm!  Oh, happy birthday, honey.
- [GLASSES CLINK.]
- Ohh!  - First legal drink! - Mm-hmm.
[SQUEALS.]
Oh, I think there's something bad in this.
That's the alcohol.
Oh.
One order of fries,  and a pop in the Faxon's Folly festival-only collector's cup.
[CROWD GRUNTS.]
What the hell?!  What'd you do that for?  That's what they're for.
When the Silligans were being chased from the Outer Rings  by the Marderian Horde, they cut weight  by dumping their food stores.
We honor their sacrifice by doing the same.
[QUIETLY.]
I know you're a newbie, but come on, Dad.
Can you at least lower your voice a little  when asking dumb questions?  That will be $26.
95.
For a pop?!  It's a collector's cup.
Well, then, I'm just gonna collect my money  and put it back in my pocket.
Ridiculous.
They think 'cause they got you trapped,  you'll pay for anything.
Great, now I got French fry all over my foot.
[CELLPHONE CHIMES.]
[GROWLS.]
"Just let Brick have the cup.
"  What did I tell ya?! I said, "Don't go texting your mom.
"  Well, I'm sorry, but you're being unreasonable.
If you're coming to something like this,  you should expect to get a souvenir cup.
I'm beginning to understand why Mom says she's the fun parent.
Well, that may be true, but you're stuck with me.
We're stuck with each other, and that's the way it is,  - so you're just gonna have - [CELLPHONE RINGS.]
[CELLPHONE BEEPS.]
Hello?  FRANKIE: You need to calm down.
What? Are you kidding me?!  That vein was popping out of your head.
I was worried about you.
I think Mom should be notified  if you're about to have a medical episode.
Suck it up, Mike.
Just let him do his weird things.
Hey, I let him do plenty.
You don't know  - [THUD.]
- [CROWD GRUNTS.]
You don't know what we've done and haven't done,  but he shouldn't be texting you.
I'm the parent on duty, I'm dealing with it.
You think I want to be getting all these texts?  Every time I try to take a selfie with Sue,  Brick keeps popping up,  telling me how awful you're being.
He threw a $5 basket of fries against the wall!  It's the Wall of Sacrifice! That's what you do.
You know, if this were Axl, you wouldn't be complaining.
You would happily go along with whatever he wanted to do.
All I'm asking is that you choose Brick.
Choose Brick?  What the hell does that even mean "Choose Brick"?  I'm saying he's your kid and he deserves your attention.
Even if you're tired, you can't just slack off.
You got to be on top of your game when it comes to your kids.
[GLASS SHATTERS.]
SUE: Happy birthday to me!  [SLURRING.]
Happy birthday to meeee!  [SQUEALING.]
I was gone five minutes.
What happened?  Everybody is so nice when it's your birthday.
They all keep giving me free drinks,  and they are all so good.
- This one is my favorite - You shouldn't be mixing.
because it's the colors of the flag.
- Okay, but - No, wait, this one  because it tickles my nose when I drink it.
[GASPS.]
No, wait!  You're all my babies.
[SIGHS DEEPLY.]
Aww!  [LAUGHS.]
From the exchange students at table nine.
- Ooh.
- Oh, no, no, no.
She's gonna need at least two more layers  to soak everything up.
I'm teaching her to drink responsibly.
Ooh, this is good.
We're gonna need one more of these.
Mnh-mnh.
FRANKIE: Yep, it was a good thing  I was there for Sue so I could teach her  how to drink responsibly.
- [WHISTLE BLOWS.]
- ALL: Shark attack!  Go, Mommy! Go, Mommy! Go!  - Whoo-hoo-hoo! - [APPLAUSE.]
[GASPS.]
Wait!  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!  Wait, wait! The dragon!  I still got to kiss the dragon.
What dragon? My ass is draggin'.
[LAUGHS.]
You said "ass.
" You're so funny.
I know!  Ooh, I got another one, I got another one.
Yeah?  My ass is draggin'.
[BOTH LAUGH.]
Oh, but Mommy, the dragon  the poor dragon is probably so lonely  out there all alone at night.
Oh, I got to go.
We got to go  got to go kiss my dragon boyfriend.
[WEAKLY.]
Okay, hang on.
[STOMACH GURGLES.]
Whew! Okay, I'm not feeling so hot.
You know what, let's just go back to the apartment,  and then you can kiss the dragon tomorrow.
What? No, I can't do that.
If I kiss the dragon on a day that's not my birthday,  it's just dumb.
Hey, Sue! Mrs.
Heck!  - Hey! - Aidan!  Whoo! Hey!  I thought I'd see if you guys were still here  and buy you a birthday drink.
We're gonna kiss the dragon.
- No dragon! Must go home! - Boo.
Uh, maybe I should show you the way to the dragon  and then make sure you both get home.
That sound okay, Mrs.
Heck?  Okay, she's gonna kiss the dragon,  then I'm gonna take her home,  and then I'm gonna kiss her little face off  because she's so cute!  Ohh.
Okay, well, come on.
Let's  - Whoo! - Yeah, yeah.
Do you know, she was 4 once.
That's right, yes.
Come on.
- I didn't know that! - Oh, watch that.
Careful.
[SIGHS.]
You know, there's sort of an unwritten rule  The passenger entertains the driver.
Sorry, I'm just trying to get something down for my toast.
- You work on yours? - Nah.
I just figure I'll start talking and see what happens.
I find, if I smile enough,  people don't really listen to what I say.
And besides, it's Kenny.
How many guests can there really be?  True.
I've never even seen him talk to another human being  besides you and my mom, that one time.
Yeah, we didn't even know his last name  till we got the invite.
Maybe we'll be the only ones there.
Well, he's got to have a family, right?  I mean, Kenny had to come from somewhere.
And if we knew where that was, it'd be great for our speech.
You think we'll have mikes?  I'll text him.
"K-bird, super-pumped for the wedding.
How many peeps?  - Mikes for speeches?" Boom.
- [CELLPHONE BLOOPS.]
Oh, and while you're at it, ask about bridesmaids.
See if he has any sisters.
You really want to get with a she-Kenny?  - [CELLPHONE CHIRPS.]
- Oh.
- Uh, "Definitely gonna be a mike.
" - Hmm.
"Have to be sure all 600 guests can hear you.
"  - 600?! - 600?!  - Are you Wh - Damn, we got nothing!  - Oh, my gosh.
- We're gonna look like idiots.
We're gonna bomb in front of 600 people.
- Okay.
- Uh uh  Sue, we should really get your mom home.
We can do the statue tomorrow.
Oh! No!  I got to kiss the dragon.
I don't think the dragon's gonna happen.
No.
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no!  Sue!  Wait, Sue! Sue!  FRANKIE: I got her!  Mrs.
Heck, that's not Sue!  I'm Sue!  - Oh, hello.
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Ooh! - Oh!  Suzy Q? What's going on?  Sean! Oh!  I'm gonna kiss the dragon.
Oh, right.
It's your 21st birthday.
Aww, you knew?  Of course.
Plus, the sash didn't hurt.
Hey, man.
Thanks for stopping her.
I'm Aidan.
Oh, I know.
Sean.
Uh Oh.
I'm trying to get these guys home,  but it's like herding drunk cats.
- Ha ha! Drunk cats.
- Pfft!  You know what, I'm on my way home.
Why don't I help make sure you get these two home safe?  Yay!  Sean's coming to the dragon!  Sue, what time were you born?  9:36 p.
m.
at night.
Why?  You're in luck.
Tradition says you have 24 hours after you turn 21  to kiss the dragon,  and you'll get a much better picture  if you take it tomorrow during the day.
Sean, you're so smart, Sean.
You should totally be a doctor, like, right now.
- Come on.
- [CHUCKLES.]
- Hi! - [LAUGHS.]
Add curly fries to the list of things  - I can't eat anymore.
- Okay.
I can't believe you made us come home early.
Early? We were there for five hours!  Some people go for three days!  And you didn't even let me buy any souvenirs.
On what planet do they charge you 26 bucks for a pop?  Uh, those are 1950s prices on Gorkon.
Brick, you don't need all that junk  the hats and the cups  and the Silligan pool floaties.
It's not supposed to be about the merchandise,  it's supposed to be the experience.
What are you doing?  Are you texting your mom when I told you not to?  "Dad is being a jerk.
"  - [CELLPHONE BLOOPS.]
- Did you seriously just call me a jerk?  [SCOFFS.]
Do you have any idea what your grandpa would've done to me  if I called him a jerk?  Actually, I didn't call you a jerk.
I described you as being a jerk.
In this instance,  "being" is an adverbial participle clause, so  Enough.
Give me your phone.
My phone that I only ever use to talk to Mom?  Forget it.
You're grounded instead.
Go to your room, and don't come out until I say.
My room with all my favorite books and Axl's super-TV?  - Okay.
- Hold it.
[SIGHS.]
There's got to be something around here  that means something to you.
Good luck.
I care about very little.
Wait.
Dad, no.
Not the microfiche!  Please! Take my phone!  I care about my phone so much!  Oh, no.
See, this is what happens  when you don't listen, Brick.
Your microfiche privileges are revoked until  [EXHALES.]
Thank God it landed on the carpet.
Those bulbs are impossible to replace.
Okay, hang on.
Just where'd the  - [GLASS SHATTERS.]
- [GASPS.]
[SIGHS.]
Thanks, Dad.
This has been the perfect day.
- Okay, read me back what we got so far.
- [EXHALES.]
Right.
Uh [CLEARS THROAT.]
"Kenny, buddy"  - Was that it? - Yeah.
I thought we had more!  [STUTTERS.]
[SIGHS.]
Man, if I was writing this about you,  it'd be a lot easier.
Oh, yeah? What would you say?  Oh, I don't know.
Probably something about, when I was in high school,  I thought I was some big shot,  gonna play football wherever I want.
Next thing I know, I'm tied up to a goalpost  next to some guy calling himself the "Ax-man.
"  [CHUCKLES.]
Thought things couldn't get any worse.
Ouch.
But suddenly, there was this cool, confident, funny guy  laughing at all my jokes, telling me how smart I am,  and actually thinking that I have good ideas.
You know, that's what's so awesome about Axl.
He has this way of making you feel good about yourself.
And, man, we can all use some of that Am I right?  So, everyone, raise your glasses to Axl  as good a friend as any guy can have.
Thanks for everything, brother.
[VOICE BREAKING.]
Pretty Pretty good.
[CHUCKLES.]
So  Uh, what would you say about me?  Oh, uh  All right.
Um  I think everyone gathered here today  in my penthouse on top of the Empire State Building know that,  despite all my incredible successes in business,  I wasn't always the best student.
In fact, I probably wouldn't have graduated at all  if it weren't for Hutch.
Yeah, I worked way harder in college  than I ever thought I could have, and it's weird,  'cause [CHUCKLES.]
the thing I remember most  is laughing, like, the whole time.
I mean, you think I could have lasted three years in an RV  with anybody else?  No.
Mnh-mnh.
Ladies and gentlemen,  I wouldn't be standing here before you today  if it weren't for this guy right here  a guy I'm lucky enough to call my best friend.
Yeah, that that'll do.
Th-That'll do.
- Sorry.
- Ow!  Okay.
Bed.
Me.
Now.
SEAN: Are you sure you're okay, Mrs.
Heck?  I am quite sure I am not.
Can I say something?  I want to say something.
I like you!  I really like you!  Think you mean this guy.
I don't think I can make it to my room.
I need to lay down.
Okay, where?  Oh.
I got it.
Here we go.
Up, up, up.
I have something else to say.
I think I'm gonna throw up.
Oh, God.
When people throw up, it makes me want to Oh!  [RETCHES.]
[COUGHS.]
[MOANS.]
[GASPS.]
Oh, no.
All my layers are in the trash.
[GASPS.]
Does this mean I'm gonna be drunk now?  No, that's not how it works.
Okay, and lean back a bit.
There you go.
Now, you're gonna feel good for about 10 minutes,  and then, after that, not so good again.
[EXHALES.]
Hmm.
Is all the vomit gone?  If the vomit's gone, will you kiss meeee?  [SMOOCHES.]
Uh, I'm Sean.
Are you talking about me or are you talking about Aidan?  Mm-hmm.
[SNORES.]
Sue, you can be a very frustrating person.
Hope you're worth waiting for.
And don't forget to hold for laughs when I do the Kenny dance.
[SIGHS.]
I'm just gonna say it, man You look pretty grown-up.
I do?  Oh, looking pretty grown-up yourself.
Really?  When did that happen?  Grown-up fist bump?      [ORGAN PLAYING.]
[COMPUTER DINGS.]
Ah, I see GIRLGAMER77 has joined us.
Now that everyone's here, shall we begin?    [KNOCK ON DOOR.]
Mnh.
[DOOR OPENS.]
Hey.
You're up.
How you feeling?  Well, I'm not so sure drinking is my thing.
Yeah.
So, sorry I bailed last night.
I've kind of got this thing  where I can't be around people puking,  or I start puking.
Yeah.
Honestly, just talking about it right now  is making me kind of  We don't have to talk about throw-up.
- Yeah, sorry.
- Yeah.
But that's what happened.
I just had to get out of here.
Nice of your neighbor guy to stick around, though.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah, it was.
- Uh, you know, Aidan - Uh-huh?  I've been thinking.
Uh, I don't know if this is exactly all working.
I-I mean, at first,  I thought maybe we were like this rom-com thing  where you were the perfect guy for me  because we were so alike,  but now I'm thinking maybe we're just too much alike.
You know?  Well, I can't say I'm completely surprised.
When you wanted to spend your 21st birthday  with your mom instead of me,  I kind of saw the writing on the wall.
I'm sorry.
Well, you'll still come see our band, right?  Of course!  So on and so forth and what have you.
Ow! Ow.
- [QUIETLY.]
I should just go.
- Yeah.
I'm gonna go.
[DOOR OPENS.]
Okay.
[SIGHS.]
So, it's good we did this,  because now I can teach you about the day after.
The day after is all about rebuilding,  and how do we do that?  Sugar in any form.
Chocolate, cookies, doughnuts straight out of the bag.
Just get them in ya.
- Mnh.
- Yeah, there you go.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
It doesn't matter what galaxy you're in,  fathers and sons will always battle,  but sometimes victory is won with strategy and not strength.
[WHISTLE BLOWS ON TELEVISION.]
[SLURPS.]
[SIGHS.]
Give me a pop  in a special-edition collector's cup.
And one of those, uh,  Menenjula Twin tote bags.
We can always use  another blue bag, right?  [CHUCKLES.]
Hey.
Any idea what size  that light bulb is?
