FRANCES: In the middle, we have a long tradition of kids raising money for their school by hitting up their neighbors to buy crap they don't want or need.
In that great tradition, Sue was selling cheese and sausage for Orson Junior High.
Four exciting varieties of sausage to match whatever sausage mood you may find yourself in.
FRANCES: What makes Sue such a good seller is that she can take rejection.
Probably because she's had so much practice.
Maybe our "Show Your Love With Cheese" cheese ball with faux granite cutting board.
I'll wait here at the door a while in case you change your mind.
FRANCES: Let me tell you, when it comes to selling cheese and sausage Sue was driven.
She was driven by Mike all over Indiana.
Hey, hey! FRANCES: Mike took her to Terre Haute.
They went to Gary.
She hit almost every county in the state.
Because if she sells $3000 worth, she wins a free trip all the way to Indianapolis.
So it's okay to sell your stuff, Sue but remember, this is a place of business.
People are busy.
[YAWNS.]
Oh, hey, Bob.
Um, would you like to help my school and send me on a trip to the state capital by buying some delicious - I'll take 10.
- Really? Oh, my God! That's great! - I love food you don't have to refrigerate.
Fridges just tie you down.
That's why I just have a hot plate and a PO box.
- Okay, that'll be $284.
- What? Are you? Ehlert.
Just casually scatter.
- Hi, Mr.
Ehlert.
Would you like to help - No.
Frances, you forgot to make coffee again.
You got me walking like an idiot with a donut and nothing to dunk it in.
Mr.
Ehlert, how come I'm the one who's always asked to make the coffee? I'm beginning to think it's because I'm a woman.
Heh, of course it's because you're a woman! The day I start telling men to make coffee for women you have my permission to put a bullet in my head.
Heh-heh-heh.
Wow, Mom, that is so unfair.
You are not going to make that coffee, are you? Ugh, not worth the fight.
MAN [OVER PA.]
: All personnel I've been informed there will be fresh coffee shortly.
Can I interest you in a cheese sampler so I can win a trip to my state capital? MAN: Put me down for the Jalape√±o Cheddar Ball.
SUE: Yes.
Oh, and if you get that I can throw in the Wild Game Sausage Trio at half price.
[MAN SIGHS.]
MAN: Fine.
FRANCES: Sue was really kicking butt.
She was a shining beacon of motivation.
Axl? Not so much.
How many times do I have to say it? Turn off that TV! Get dressed for school! It will take me like two seconds.
Chill.
Hey, hey.
Only one to a customer.
It's for Olivia.
- I'm sorry, honey, who? - Olivia.
My girlfriend.
So this girlfriend of yours, is she here right now? - No, she's at her house.
- Ah.
So how did this happen? - You're my boyfriend now.
- Okay.
- Wow, Brick.
That's great.
- So this Olivia, do you like her? She says I do.
Is she cute? Is she nice? She has a red ribbon in her hair.
I like red ribbons.
All Heck men like red ribbons.
Red ribbons.
Mom, we're out of cereal.
You going to the store or what? I will go to the store when I decide it's time to go to the store.
- We're almost out of a lot of stuff.
After work.
First I gotta go to the post office then by Aunt Edie and Aunt Ginny's.
They're hosting bridge club and they're almost out of Scotch.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I did it! I sold over $3000 worth of cheese and sausage! - Oh, honey, that's terrific! - That's great, Sue! I know.
I just have to send the checks to the company and then I'm off to Indianapolis! The capital! Heh! Oh, honey, I am so proud of you.
You worked hard and it paid off.
And now you get to see close-up how Indiana state government works.
- I know.
It's like a dream! Heh.
[BUS HORN HONKING.]
Damn it, Axl! I told you, turn off the TV and get ready for school! Now the bus is here and you're not ready! [GRUNTS.]
I told you, two seconds.
Chill.
How the hell does he do that? Now that you're my boyfriend, you have to buy ice cream tell me I'm pretty, and walk me to and from recess and lunch.
I made you a list so you don't forget.
Okay.
The crash rating on this baby, two stars.
Not one, but two.
- Out of how many? - Five.
But who cares? If you crash, the doors are so thin, they will cut you out like that.
[FRANCES GASPS.]
Sue, what are you doing here? The school put up a list of winners for the trip and my name wasn't on it.
- What? - Does this car? - Everything.
Give me a minute.
- But you were a top seller.
- I know.
Can you believe it? FRANCES: Unfortunately, I could believe it.
This was Sue's whole life in a nutshell.
She tries and tries and never gets any recognition.
It's like people don't even see her.
- Sue Heck? - Here.
- Sue Heck? - Here.
Okay, not here.
- Pizza or fish? - Pizza, please.
Oh, okay.
ALL [SINGING.]
: Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear [ALL MUTTER INDISTINCTLY.]
Happy birthday to you [SIGHS.]
- Honey, that's just not fair.
- What's not fair? Sue sold enough sausage and cheese to win the big trip she's not on the list.
Oh, those monsters! I'm gonna cancel my check.
Looks like I'm not going to Indianapolis.
I was really looking forward to it too.
What are you talking about? This is just a mistake.
Things like this happen all the time.
Yes, more often to you, but we'll straighten it out.
Eh, it's not worth the fight.
FRANCES: Great.
Why do I have to be the only mom in the world whose teenager listens to what they say? Then Sue turns to me and says: - "Eh, it's not worth the fight.
" - That's your fault.
- She gets that from you.
- I said it once.
- You say it all the time.
- I do not.
- Hey, we don't wear flip-flops to church.
- Jesus wore sandals.
Eh, it's not worth the fight.
I'm not paying $6 a month for other fees unless you tell me what those fees are.
No, don't transfer me to India.
Don't transfer me Eh, it's not worth the fight.
Well, the kids are asleep.
So Honey, I am so exhausted.
Eh, it's not worth the fight.
And I said it to Mr.
Ehlert right in front of her.
Oh, my God.
- Am I a horrible mother? - Too soon to tell.
It's just so unfair.
I mean, for once in her life Sue finally wins something and then that stupid school has to go and screw it all up.
She earned that trip.
We earned that trip.
Hell, yeah.
I'm the one that spent Oh, did you know her friend Stacy likes a boy named Ben? But Ben likes Stacy's friend Madison so now they're not talking to her.
- Want more? I got lots more.
- I have got to fix this.
Sue has to stand up for herself.
If this isn't worth the fight, Mike I don't know what is.
Hey, Sue! Get in here! You know what this is? A teachable moment.
I saw that on Oprah.
Or Project Runway or something.
I don't remember, but it's teachable.
- Am I in trouble? - Sue.
I want you to march into that school talk to who's ever in charge and get yourself on that trip.
I don't know.
Mr.
Perez, the teacher, is kind of weird.
Someone saw him crying in the parking lot.
It doesn't matter.
You can't be invisible, Sue.
You've gotta stand up and fight for what's yours.
I don't always do that, but I've had kids.
I'm tired.
Don't be afraid to stare him down.
Wow, okay.
[DOORBELL RINGS.]
Got it.
How's this? You got a little something Lose the stare.
Just be yourself.
AXL: Hey, Brick's girlfriend's here.
- Ooh! Hello, Olivia.
So nice to meet you.
Hi.
Can Brick come out and play? Hey, Brick.
Your girlfriend's here.
- Go out there and have fun.
- I don't want to.
You're not getting a lot of offers, bud.
Come on, she's cute.
I told you I'd be here at 3.
Why weren't you waiting outside? And make sure you're free on Saturday.
We have a birthday party.
You forgot, didn't you? It's like you don't hear a word I'm saying.
I hear all the words, Olivia.
All of them.
[WHISPERING.]
All of them.
And why do you whisper to yourself? It's so annoying.
FRANCES: This was a big step for Sue.
She was finally making a stand.
Yep, this girl was gonna be heard.
Eventually.
[CLEARS THROAT.]
Mr.
Perez? I sold over $3000 of cheese and sausage to, you know, go on the trip to Indianapolis.
- Who are you? - Sue.
Sue Heck.
- I'm in your fifth period Spanish class? - I don't think so.
Anyway, I sold over $3000 worth of cheese and sausage to, you know, go on the trip to Indianapolis.
Good for you, Sandy.
See you on the bus.
See, that's the thing.
I'm not on the list.
- But I sold over - Okay, I'll look into it.
Really? Gracias, heh! [SPEAKING IN SPANISH.]
[LAUGHING.]
- How do you break up with a girl? - You wanna break up with that chick? You're a weird dude.
You got a hottie that likes you.
- I'm sure.
- All right.
Girls like it when you to talk to them so try blowing her off or something.
How do I do that? Like this.
[GUNFIRE ON TV.]
Great advice, Axl! Now we're married and we have a baby! FRANCES: I really thought I nailed the Sue thing.
I had taught her to stand up for herself.
I was so pumped I was even making dinner.
Yup, she's lucky to have me.
I did it.
I talked to Mr.
Perez.
And neither one of us cried.
Oh, great.
SUE: I did it, Dad.
Heh.
I was a little bit scared at first Okay, a lot scared.
Heh.
But I stood my ground and explained the situation.
And? And he said he'd look into it! Yay! Heh.
- All right.
See, there you go.
- Oh! That's great.
- You stood up for yourself.
- Good for you.
Good girl.
- I'm going there and talk to that guy.
- Wait.
Didn't you hear her? - He'd look into it.
- He's blowing her off.
I tell people all day I'll look into it.
I never do.
No.
We are not doing this for her.
We are not helicopter parenting.
FRANCES: Regis and Kelly.
You saw how excited she was.
If you go, you're gonna undermine her self-confidence.
She will never learn to fight her own battles.
The trip is in two weeks.
If we don't hear before then, we'll step in.
So while I had one kid desperately trying to get into something I had another desperately trying to get out.
[DOORBELL RINGS.]
It's her! Don't make me go out.
I'll do any kind of social interaction you want me to.
There's this new boy in my class who eats his boogers.
I bet he'd be my friend.
Anyone but Olivia.
So if you don't like her, don't play with her.
I tried.
It's not that easy.
Okay.
Relax.
I'll take care of it.
Can Brick come out and play? Look, Olivia, Brick asked me to speak to you.
Because he thinks you're a very nice girl, but he's not ready to get married.
But he wants to remain friends because he likes you very much.
It's too late.
We're already married and we have kids.
What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.
Okay, how about this? You're not really married and your kids are dolls.
So why don't you head home and Brick will see you around school? Okay, hon? - Nope.
- What? I've put too much time into this relationship to just walk away.
- Well, I think you have to.
- Nope.
- You can't keep saying nope.
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.
Enough.
I'm not gonna get into this.
I'm the grown-up and I don't have to.
Sorry it came down to this, but, uh, it's over, okay? Brick doesn't wanna see you anymore.
- Got it? - Nope.
Go home, Olivia.
How are you gonna make me? Brick, Olivia's here! FRANCES: Morning.
Trip to Indianapolis is today and they didn't call.
I was all packed and everything.
I'll never see the state seal up close.
What? No, no, no.
You said the trip is next Saturday.
It was next Saturday when I said it.
Now it's today.
It's today? What? They can't do that.
They said they'd look into it.
I'm beginning to think they didn't.
That's it.
Come on.
Get your stuff.
What time is the bus leaving? It's okay, Mom.
They already left.
It's not worth Uh-uh-uh.
Don't you dare say it.
You deserve this, Sue.
Because you try and try long past when others would stop trying and damn it, you are going on this trip.
- Mom, you're still in pajamas.
- They're drawstring.
It's almost pants.
[HONKING.]
Pull the bus over! Okay.
I know this doesn't look safe, but I have dual air bags.
- You! I'm talking to you! - I think.
Open up! Yes, I am talking to you.
My daughter, Sue Heck, is supposed to be on this bus! Are those pajamas? They're drawstring.
It's almost pants.
She's not on the list.
Wanna take it from here? Really give it to him.
Um, I sold more than enough cheese and sausage to be on this trip.
She sold more than enough to be on this trip! I demand to be on this bus.
She demands! - I strongly suggest - Strongly suggests I'm gonna take it from here.
Good job, though.
I've got your number, Mr.
Perez.
You never had any intention of looking into this now, did you? I called the company.
They had no record of Sue Heck selling anything.
That is baloney.
Nobody ever has a record of Sue.
But I was there.
She counted the orders, we mailed in those checks and she is getting on this bus! Go.
- Go.
- I'm sorry.
I can't allow that.
Oh, okay.
- Get back on that bus, Sue.
- Okay.
- No.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
You're gonna penalize this innocent young girl because you and that stupid company can't get your acts together? What message are you sending to our young people? Hard work doesn't pay off? That's what she's hearing, loud and clear.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
We just lost another teen to cynicism.
So are you gonna let my daughter get on or not? Eh, it's not worth the fight.
FRANCES: Oh, God.
I thought I mailed Sue's envelope.
I really did.
I gotta stop putting crap up there.
- I can't do it anymore.
- So you're stuck with her.
It's not all bad.
Olivia's got her strong points.
She's strong.
- I know.
She threw a pumpkin at a car.
If you got pretend married, why don't you get pretend divorced? She said if we ever broke up, she'd take half my books and we'd split the babies.
She'd get Strawberry Shortcake and I'd get Rainbow Brite.
I'm not even sure if Rainbow Brite is mine.
I don't know what to tell you, Brick.
Women are complicated.
They're not simple and straightforward like us guys.
Yeah.
I only got two thoughts in my head, driving and sex.
Oh, grades.
I mean, driving and grades.
Unfortunately, she's the kind of girl who won't move on until she's found some other poor sucker she can torment.
Hmm.
Oh, yeah.
Olivia called earlier.
She wants you to buy her lunch tomorrow.
She said it's her favorite and that you would know it is.
Oh, God.
I don't.
- Hey, Sue make it on the bus? - Uh-huh.
All right! That ought to feel good.
Yeah, it does.
It really does.
Yeah, she's lucky to have me.
Well, at least she'd be gone for four days.
Four days is a long time.
Plenty of time for forgiveness.
And she did write.
Until finally Sue.
I am so, so sorry.
I went to the post office.
Before I could go in, Aunt Ginny called.
Then Brick needed more goldfish and I had a million things in my head I love you.
I love you so much.
It was a disaster! Because you forgot to mail in the envelope my name wasn't on any of the lists! I had to sleep on the floor in the hotel.
They didn't have tickets to any of the museums! I missed the state government in action! A junior guidance counselor had to sit with me everywhere because legally I couldn't be left alone! I'm not invisible to Miss Glover now! No, she hates me! This is all your fault! FRANCES: There it was, Sue found her voice.
And boy, was it loud.
I didn't deserve this.
I strongly suggest No.
Demand that you make it up to me! FRANCES: Yeah.
My girl was a fighter.
She was gonna be fine.
And all the cheese and sausage in the world doesn't make you feel prouder than that.
Oh, and Brick? Turns out he could take care of himself too.
- You're my boyfriend now.
- Okay.
FRANCES: Damn, I'm good.
