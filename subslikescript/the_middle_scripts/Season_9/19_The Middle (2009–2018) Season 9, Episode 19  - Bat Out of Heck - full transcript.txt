What are you doing?
Looking for spoons.
I'm finally back up to three.
If I can find two more,
then we can all eat pudding
at the same time.
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my God.
Nobody's ever been
this interested in me before.
I'm looking for spoons.
She wants us to eat pudding.
I don't want pudding.
Me neither, but it
seems important to her.
Nobody has to eat pudding.
I am just using that
as an example of something
that a family with
a normal amount of spoons
could eat together.
[SIGHS]
All right, what is this?
Oh, that's an order form.
I need to sell 25 boxes of peanut brittle
to raise money for the sophomore class.
It's due in two days,
so you're going to need to
hustle to sell those at work.
[SIGHS] Brick,
I can't sell peanut brittle
at a dentist's office.
Not with that attitude.
[SQUEAKING]
- Did you see that?
- See what?
I don't know. I just saw something.
Hmm. You're digging
in a backpack looking for silverware,
you're seeing things,
you're wearing one slipper.
You're this close to being that lady
who wanders around the highway median.
Actually, she wears two slippers.
I'm going to need your keys for tomorrow
so I can make sales calls.
Why is there a spoon in here?
Oh, good. That's four.
Okay, Mike, I'll drop you off
and take your car.
I don't like this idea.
I don't get dropped places. I drive.
Relax, Fred Flintstone.
You can drive to your work,
and after you get out,
I'll drive to mine.
Why is he Fred Flintstone?
Because he's acting like a caveman.
I thought it's 'cause
he works in a quarry.
I thought she meant 'cause
he powers his car with his feet.
If Fred Flintstone moves the car
with his feet,
why doesn't he just walk at that point?
'Cause if he walks,
he can't listen to the radio.
They didn't have iPods back then.
They didn't have radios, either.
Obviously, you've never seen the show!
I'm not going to miss you guys
when you move out of the house.
I know I'm supposed to, but I won't.
I can't let you take the car, anyway.
I got a lunch meeting.
[SIGHS] Oh, no. I hate
having to get a ride in
with Dr. Goodwin.
He thinks it's rude to honk,
so anytime a car in front of us
doesn't move,
he yells, "Toot toot!"
Well, it's only going to be
for another couple of days
because I'm trading in
the 'Bago for a car.
Seriously? A real car?
You're really going to say
goodbye to the 'Bago?
Yep. End of an era.
I'll miss it.
It went with the general
poverty theme we got going.
Yeah.
Listen... You make sure,
when you go in there, you know
what you're looking for.
You need snow tires
'cause you drive in winter.
- Yes, I know I drive in the winter.
- Okay.
FRANKIE: Unfortunately, whenever you have
two grown men in the house,
one has to assert his dominance
over the other,
and, in our case, it was
always gonna be Mike.
You're gonna want
to kill the heat on that
or your eggs will be chewy.
- [CHATTER ON TELEVISION]
- [LAUGHS]
[VOLUME DECREASES] Keep
it at 26 for sports,
14 for regular TV.
You don't squeeze. You roll.
We're not made of toothpaste.
Now, listen to me,
you don't want to set foot
in a car dealership
until you've done your research
and you know your price.
We should talk about this.
Uh, of course we should.
Hey! Here's my other slipper.
What is this doing in here?
[CHUCKLES TRIUMPHANTLY]
Who's crazy now, huh?
You saw that, right?
Now, before we end,
I have these applications
for the Franklin Butterfield
Hotels and Resorts Scholarship.
It's very prestigious
and very competitive.
I don't want to discourage
any of you from applying,
but, well, I would discourage
any of you from applying.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]
Hi, yeah, excuse me.
Um, I'm interested in the scholarship.
Oh. You understand nobody from East Indy
has ever made it to the finals.
Well, then, I guess we're due.
- [SIGHS]
- I just don't want you
to have unrealistic expectations.
If you can dream it, you can do it.
That's actually from a poster
on my wall at home.
I also have one that says
honesty is the best policy,
which is why I felt compelled to tell you
about the "dream it, do it" thing.
♪
[SQUEALS]
♪
Thanks again for the ride.
It won't be for much longer.
Axl's buying a car.
Oh, I enjoy the company.
But can you do me a favor and ask Treeva
to stop going through people's
lunch in the fridge?
With this whole #MeToo movement,
I'm too nervous I'll say something wrong.
Sorry, but I can't get up
in anybody's grill today.
I have to ask people
to buy peanut brittle
for Brick's class.
Ooh! I'll take some!
You will? Thank you.
How much do you want?
How much you got?
Well, he's supposed to sell 25 boxes.
Sold!
What? No, you don't have to buy all 25.
I want to. We're friends.
I mean platonic friends.
My eyes are on the road,
and I don't notice that
you smell like honeysuckle.
[SNIFFS]
Oh, Axl.
Okay, so, I'm applying
for this scholarship,
and it's really hard to get,
and I really want it,
and I need three words
to describe myself.
Annoying, dorky, looks good in hats.
You think I look good in hats?
[GASPS] Aww.
[DOOR CLOSES]
You really got to talk to your husband.
Ugh, why?
'Cause he's on me all the time lately,
just looming over me.
You know, he thinks anything
I do he can do better.
[CHUCKLES] Like the song?
What song?
"Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Better."
Never heard of it. Don't sing it!
I just need you to talk to him.
Why don't you talk to him?
'Cause I can't talk to him.
He'll be all like...
[GROWLS]
I don't know what that means.
- I think you do.
- I totally do.
That's why I'm making you
be the one who has to talk to him.
♪
[CAR DOOR CLOSES] Okay.
The 7/11 may not work anymore
as a pick-up spot.
Apparently, you are not allowed
to refill your coffee cup
with Slurpee. [SLURPS]
Oh.
Oh, you don't have
the peanut brittle with you?
What? Oh, no, Brick has to order it.
Oh. You didn't say that.
Kind of had my hopes up
for some peanut brittle.
[SLURPS] Really?
Oh, I thought you were just being nice.
No, no. I'm Southern...
I love peanut brittle,
and thought I was gonna get some today.
[CHUCKLES]
So, when's it coming in?
[SLURPS] I don't know.
Can you call Brick and find out?
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

Okay, my professor said
this was going to be hard,
but it's really hard!
There are 10 essay questions.
Listen to this... "What hotel trends
do you see in the year 2028?"
How should I know?
We've never stayed in a nice one!
Other than Disney World
for that one night,
the only places we've ever
stayed are the kinds
where you drive right up to the door
and we carry our clothes
in paper bags to the room.
Okay, before we get too deep into this,
I'm going to need to
take it back on the hats.
Axl, I don't need your approval
on whether or not I look good in hats.
I'm just putting this down right
here because my head is hot.
Okay. I am so mad at Dad.
He's always telling us what to do.
Don't you hate that?
I love that. I love Dad's advice.
He is so wise.
Okay, if Dad is bugging you,
then why don't you just talk to him?
'Cause it's him. I don't want to run into
the big, plaid, bossy wall.
Okay, I hardly ever
get annoyed at Mom and Dad,
but when I do, I just
imagine that they're dead
and then when I realize that they're not,
I run up and hug them.
That's lame.
♪
Did you get those chips I wanted?
Uh, no.
See? What did I say before you left?
"Write it down."
You didn't and you forgot.
I didn't forget. They were out.
They were out?
It's what I said.
The entire Frugal Hoosier? Out of chips?
No, Dad, I'm lying to you.
It's how I get my kicks.
Look, I didn't forget any chips.
If there were chips,
you would have chips,
but there were no chips,
so I didn't get the chips.
But I did not forget the chips.
I forgot the chips.
Did you remember my juice boxes?
They were out.
Look, Dad told me to write down chips,
and I didn't,
and if he finds out I forgot them,
he'll never let me hear the end of it,
and I really need to hear the end of it
because he's been on me
like crazy lately,
and don't tell me you love Dad's advice!
Well, he doesn't talk to me.
Well, then, you're lucky,
because he's all up in my business
all the time.
Ah, I see what's going on here.
It's nature.
The younger male challenging
the older male,
the older male swiping back.
It's two rams locking horns
on a mountain,
two lions in a pride
fighting for dominance.
Usually, the younger lion
will kill the older lion,
and then that lion would have
the female lions in the house
to mate with.
Ew! Nature is messed up.
Look, I just need your help, all right?
Because Dad won't
believe me about the chips.
He shouldn't believe you. You're lying.
He doesn't know that!
I think he does.
Well... That's where you come in.
I am going to pretend
to call the Frugal Hoosier,
and you're going
to pretend to work there.
Look, I'm changing your name
in my phone to "Frugal Hoosier"
instead of "Dork Nerdington."
I'm in your phone?
So, when I call you,
put you on speaker phone,
you pretend to work there
and say, "We're out of chips."
Wouldn't it be easier
to just talk to him directly?
No, trust me. I know
what I'm doing here, okay?
Using my brother to pretend
to be the guy at Frugal Hoosier
is the smart way to handle this.
♪
Look, Dad, I feel like
you weirdly don't believe me
about the chips,
so I'm gonna call the Frugal Hoosier
- and prove it.

I really don't care that much, Axl.
- [RINGING]
- No, no, no. I want to.
BRICK: [SOUTHERN ACCENT] Frugal Hoosier,

Dustin speaking.
Hello, Dustin.
I was just there,
and you said you were out of chips?
What? Out of chips?
Hey, Harry. We out of chips?
Sorry, man. We're out of chips.
But we do currently have
a special on sub sandwiches...
buy three feet, get three feet free.
Okay. Thanks, man. Bye.
Sounds like a good deal on subs there.
You got to take a good deal
when you see one.
Why didn't you think to bring one home?
I did.
Shut up.
[SQUEAKING]
Sue, did you hear that?
What? The sound of my dreams
crashing down to earth?
The sound of the voices in my head
telling me I'm a failure?
No, it was more of a squeaky sound.
Mom, this application is due tonight,
and I am a wreck.
You know, I had a dream I didn't get it,
but then I woke up,
and I was so relieved,
but then that turned out to be a dream,
and I woke up again,
but then that was a dream!
I'm not sure I'm awake right now.
Well, whether you get it or not,
we're just so proud of you for trying.
But I don't want to just try!
I want to win! But how can I?
Is my last name "Hilton" or
"Marriott" or "Comfort Inn"?
No! I am just plain old Sue Heck.
[GASPS] You know,
it's these stupid posters
giving me false hope.
Yeah! Who was I to think
I could reach for the stars
or go out on a limb?!
- Sue!
- People fall off limbs!
Yeah! People die in space!
Gah!
Sue, Sue, stop.
I know you can do this.
You just need to calm...

FRANKIE: I'm the only one

Can you believe it? I have a "quality"!

Yeah. Things are happening for me!

Unfortunately, he wasn't alone.
PETE: Hey, you're

Well, I want to trade in

you'll sell it for $600,
so you're making $200 right there.
You're asking $5,500 for this,
