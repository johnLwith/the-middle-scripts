Oh, ho ho!
In your face, poor people.
Daddy just got paid.
And by "Daddy," I mean me,
not the tall, beaten-down-looking guy
in the flannel shirt.
Mm. Well, good for you.
50 more years, and you can quit.
[CLICKS TONGUE] So, Dad,
what did you get
with your first paycheck?
Well, I bought this belt.
Since you've already got a belt,
do the responsible thing
and put that in the bank.
Right, Frankie?
Absolutely.
Okay, don't listen to him.
Listen to me.
You know how people say life
is too short?
Well, it's not. It's too long,
and there's no fun in it.
So, before you get sucked in
to its black hole,
take some of that money
and buy yourself something nice.
It'll be our little secret.
Uh, I'm in the room.
Sweet!
Just between you and I.
When I get my first paycheck,
I'm gonna pay people to notice me!
- [SIGHS]
- What are you doing home?
Well, it's my winter break.
Ah, yes.
You must be exhausted
after those two weeks of school
you had after your Christmas break.
Ugh, I know, right?
I really am.
Even my sarcasm goes unnoticed.
Did you say something?
I'm beginning to feel
like a literary character
I've recently discovered.
You see, there's this boy
with a very round head,
and he has a dog that sleeps
on top of his doghouse.
Apparently, he was
a World War I fighter pilot.
If you can suspend disbelief,
it all works.
You're talking about Charlie Brown.
Then you've heard of it!
Everyone has.
Great. So I'm the last to know.
Will the indignities never end?
Axl's getting paychecks,
you're on a nonstop vacation.
Why is it never my turn?
What does the universe have against me?
[GLASS SHATTERS]
It's okay, Brick!
We can put up another picture of you.
[SIGHS] There is no other picture of me.
Mm. Hey.
Lexie gave me her Netflix login.
You wanna watch a movie tonight?
Unlike you, who's always on vacation,
I have homework to do.
I'll watch a movie with you.
Oh. Great.
If you're looking for a pop,
I just grabbed the last one.
Good grief!

[DOG BARKS IN DISTANCE]
Okay, I got it down to
"Undercover Justice:
Special Ops,"
or something about a guy and a girl
in a cheese shop.
I vote for "Undercover Justice."
Me, too. Chris Pine is in it.
- He is so cute!
- Mm-hmm.
And I hear he never drinks

How was the movie with Sue?
Did you stay awake
through the whole thing?
Oh, I stayed awake all right.
Oh! What does that mean?
Well, I saw
a little bit more of Chris Pine
than I bargained for.
Oh, really? Was there a sex scene?
Oh, sheesh.
Ask me what wasn't a sex scene.
It'll take less time.
It was uncomfortable, Frankie.
I didn't appreciate watching
that with my daughter.
Well, why'd you pick that movie?
It was called "Undercover Justice:
Special Ops."
I assumed it was a war movie.
And by the way,
they weren't under the covers,
not even once. Well, shake it off.
It was one awkward night.
Well, it wasn't the movie.
It was...
I was just trying to spend
a little time with Sue.
Why? That's not like you.
Yeah, well...
She wanted someone to watch with,
and lately it seems like
she just doesn't
hang out with me as much.
Are you sad?
Are you feeling feelings of sadness?
Aww!
This is why I don't tell you stuff.
No, no, no. I like it
when you talk to me.
I won't think you're cute. I promise.
Go on.
Well, just lately
she [CLICKS TONGUE] doesn't
return my texts half the time.
She hasn't made me a scrapbook in years.
Mm-hmm.
If you hug me, I'm not talking
to you anymore.
Okay.
Listen.
You had it really easy with her
when she was little.
She would follow you around,
clean the gutters with you
just to be with you.
She's grown up now, and
she's got other stuff going on,
so you just have to find
new ways to connect with her.
[SIGHS] Well, I've tried
making conversation,
but it's like driving.
If I don't think about it, I'm fine,
but as soon as I think about it,
I can't stay in my own lane.
I'm swerving.
I never used to have
to think about it with her,
and now I do, and I'm all over the road.
Aww. You'll find it. You'll see.
In the meantime,
how 'bout a little "Undercover
Justice" before work?
- Hmm?
- No. [CHUCKLES]

hard-to-button pants on.

Relax! I had that, too.
Wh... How could you do this?
Do what?
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.
I'm not being clear.
This! This! This!
It was your idea!
Remember... you said it'd be
our little secret.
You gotta take this back.
I can't. It was final sale.
Oh, my God. Your dad was right.
I was an idiot to think
that you could be trusted
with your own money!
Mom, I know what I'm doing, all right?
I just gave this whole speech to Lexie
about how we have to not spend so much.
You're a man now, Axl.
What, are you gonna live here forever?
You're gonna get married, have kids,
and you're all just gonna
live in this room?

whispering in the corner?"
"Oh, that's your Uncle Brick.
He lives here, too."

What am I gonna do?!
I'm doomed!
This is all your fault!
You gave me bad advice.
You gave me your
bad money-management gene.
- What?!
- Yeah!
You can't balance a checkbook.
You leave your wallet in the freezer!
That's menopause!
[SIGHS] Okay.
Pointing fingers
isn't gonna solve anything.
I mean, you're right.
The truth is I have never
been good with money either.
Maybe this whole TV thing
is a-a wake-up call.
Maybe we can learn
to be financially responsible
together, right?
Keep an eye on each other,
like checks and balances.
That's a thing, right?
I think so.
I thought you were a business major!
You said no pointing fingers!
You're right.
We're in this together.
And what's most important is,
we don't need to tell your dad about it.

on the front door?
Ah, I thought you'd pick up my vibe.
Remember how we always had
that special brotherly bond
where we could read each other's minds?

So, what are you doing back in town?
Last I heard, you were in Tampa.

That's the date.
Oh.
Hey, remember how I said
I was tired of being ignored?
No. Was I in the room?
Well, I think the universe
is bestowing gifts upon me
to make up for it.
Every time I open the front door,
there's a new delight waiting for me.
I don't know why it's happening.
I'm just gonna enjoy it.
Ye... I'm confused about this...
you spend so much money on groceries,
but we don't eat well, like, ever.
Yeah, see, I keep buying food
thinking I'm gonna cook,
and then I get tired,
and I just get takeout.
Oh. Takeout's a pretty big one
for me, too.
Maybe we could both cut back on that.
I can start brown bagging my lunch.
Yeah! And new rule...
I don't buy any new food

It does!

[SIGHS] All right,
two of us are having waffles.
Ooh, cut the corner off that top one.
I don't like the look of that.
Oh, and that meat over there?
Could be cake.
I'm only warning you because,
even though cake is delicious,
it's a weird sensation
if you're expecting meat.
What's going on here?
Oh, we're not wasting food anymore.
So we're gonna eat everything
that's in the freezer.
So, Uncle Rusty,
whatcha been up to lately?
Oh, I was in Tampa renting out Jet Skis.
They weren't my Jet Skis,
they were another guy's,
so that became a problem.
But I got something better
I'm working on now.
Better than stealing
another guy's Jet Skis?
Well, that remains to be seen.
But you guys know what bubble wrap is?
Well, I'm making bubble-wrap clothes
for old people
because they're always falling down,
breaking their old bones,
but if you wrap 'em
real tight with bubble wrap,
they're protected.
Also, it'll get the grandkids over more
because little kids love
to pop bubble wrap.
[CHUCKLES]
Like you, little boy.
Do you like to pop bubble wrap?
I'm 16. I shave.
But yes.
Which brings me to why I came today.
Okay, trust me when I tell you, Rusty,
we're not in a position
to give you any money.
No, I don't need any money.
I just came by to bring
something special for the girl.
[GASPS] Oh! For me?
Well, I certainly wouldn't
call her a "girl."
[LAUGHS]
Is it for my birthday next month?
Oh, sure.
Oh, thank you, but I don't smoke.
Not that I judge people who do.
That's a lie. I judge them.
I judge them very much.
Oh, no, cigarettes will kill you.
No, I-I never touch them.
Yeah, I only smoked the 20
that were in here
on the way over
to make room for the gift.
Hmm.
Ooh!
[GASPS]
Ahh!
Oh, my God.
Oh, it's beautiful!
It look so real,
like the kind of necklace
you need a salesperson at Zales
to open up the case to look at.
Yeah. It is real.
Wh...
Oh, my God. Look.
FRANKIE: Ooh! Oh!
Rusty, it's a ruby necklace.
Rusty, that is beautiful.
[SQUEALING] Oh, thank you!
[CHUCKLES] Look at that.

Hey, Dad, great news.
The necklace goes with
almost all my clothes.
I have a lot of stuff with hearts on it,
and apples, weirdly.
Yeah. Sue, um... listen,
you know Uncle Rusty's history.
I'm not... sure
what the deal is with that necklace.
Oh, no, no. It is definitely real.
[GASPS] Look at my neck, huh?
Not green at all.
Yeah, well, if it's real,
that could be a bigger problem.
Could be hot. "Hot"?
Hot. What do you mean "hot"?
You don't know that "hot" means "stolen"?
Well, you don't have
to make me feel bad about it.
I'm not trying to make you feel...
Never mind.
I just need you to give me the necklace
so I can give it back to Rusty.
What? No.
Okay, I'm sorry, Dad,
but you always assume the worst
with Uncle Rusty,
and I am just not an
assume-the-worst kind of person.
Did you even talk to him?
You heard what he said
about the Jet Skis, right?
I just think you have
a certain proclivity
for thinking your brother is a criminal.
This was a nice moment
between me and Uncle Rusty,
and I'm not sure
why you're trying to ruin it.

so I can give it back to Rusty,
and she said no.
What is going on with her?
She's like a different person.
Why would you give the necklace
back to Rusty?
[SCOFFS] Oh, come on.
He probably grifted it
off some old lady in Tampa.
That's why he's suddenly back in town.
He's on the lam.
Lamb! That's what that meat was tonight.
She's a piece of work.
She told me I had a proclivity.
What does that mean?
Well, "proclivity" means...
I-I know the word, Frankie.
And what's with this giant TV?
Where the hell did that come from?
Axl blew his first paycheck
on it, and I'm so mad.
L-Let's stay on Sue.
I don't even recognize her anymore.
Where's that little girl
that used to ask me
if I worked for God 'cause I'm so tall
I can reach Heaven.
That little girl
would give me the necklace.
Okay.
I'm gonna float an idea here.
I'm not saying it's true.
I'm just gonna spitball.

Is it possible that [SIGHS]
Maybe you're a little jealous?
[SCOFFS] I'm not jealous!
W-Well, what, I mean, look...
we both know that he made some good money
selling the diaper business.
It's possible that he bought
that necklace.
I-I mean, have you even talked to him?
Why does everyone keep asking me that?
I don't have to talk to him.
I know him. I grew up with him.
I know him better than anybody,
and I'm not trying to ruin their moment!
I don't care if they have a moment.
I have plenty of moments with Sue.
Not recently, but you know
what's a moment?
When the cops knock down the door,
yank that necklace from around her neck,
and drag Rusty off.
That's a moment I would like to see.
Maybe I am jealous.

"...yet what is most distinct
about bottom-up investing
is that it does not rely

but on one particular company."

When will you stop throwing that
in my face?
[SIGHS] Okay.
Let's try another book.
No! I don't want to hear anymore
of you reading to me.
Oh, you used to love it
when I read to you.
You could not get enough

Do you remember that book?
Yeah. [CHUCKLES]
Too bad there's no
"Dumb Bunnies Teach Finance."
This stuff might actually be fun
to learn.
Yeah.
[SIGHS]
Yeah.
We should do that.
Do what?
We should write a book on finance
that's fun and so simple that even kids
and bozos like us could understand it.
I mean, we can't be the
only ones going through this.
There's gotta be
stupider people out there.
- There could be.

I think we all laughed at Flounder.
Oh, come on! I draw them awesome,
and they're already trademarked.
You trademarked the Buttronauts?
Um, hello? I'm a business major.
I just don't know how wide an appeal
butt astronauts would have.
Butts are funny,
and astronauts garner respect.
People will love learning from them.
- Butts are funny.
- Yeah.
We could have a...
an accountant Buttronaut.
He could wear glasses.
Glasses on a butt... I don't know.
I do know.
Glasses on a butt is gold.
But butts don't have noses.
What's holding the glasses up?
The crack is a
perfect substitute for the nose.
It is right in the middle
of the butt face, as it were.
A nose goes out. A crack goes in.
It can't hold glasses.
You're thinking three-dimensionally,
but in a book, cracks and noses
have equal depth. I mean, wow.
This is all falling into place.
Okay, so we need to write it
on the most basic level.
Something so easy, even a kid
could understand it.
How do we do that?
Well, first you have to understand it
on an adult level.
How do we do that?

It was given to you, huh?
Yeah. Dad gave it to me.
What?
Remember when I got kicked out
of the Marines
and I came back and lived with Dad?
Well, I saw the necklace,
and I asked if I could have it
so I can give it to my daughter someday.
But it looks like I'm never
gonna have a daughter of my own,
so...
Well, you don't know that for sure.
Eh, I'm 50.

You never heard of a boy named Sue?
I heard of the song.
That's a song?
Anyway, it was an extravagant gift
that came out of nowhere, so...
Well, I just thought she should have it.
She deserves it.
I mean, things are tough enough for her
going through life
with a boy's name, you know?
Plus, Mom would've wanted it that way.
What do you mean?
Well, it was Mom's.
