FRANKIE: From the outside you can see
we're just your average family.
Sure we're a little disorganized...
[TRUCK BEEPING]
Is that the garbage truck?
What time is it?
- Mike, did you take out the trash?
- It's Axl's turn.
Trash day! Bring out your trash!
Come on, guys. Move.
Trash truck's a block away.
Okay, okay, I know it probably looks
insane to be so nuts about trash day...
...but, see, due to cutbacks trash pickup
only happens once every two weeks.
If you miss it, you're screwed.
We're never gonna make it.
- Brick, what are you doing there?
- I'm tired of sleeping with Axl.
His bed's always squeaking.
I want my own room.
- How long have you been sleeping there?
- A month.
All right, whatever,
just get rid of your trash.
I don't understand why
nobody obeys the chore chart.
Axl was to take out the garbage.
Sue was to clean up.
Why do I bother making a chore chart
if nobody pays any attention to it?
There's nothing on it.
Yeah, because I haven't bought
the dry-erase markers, but it's up here...
...and you're supposed to remember
what I told you.
I swear, I spend my whole life
cleaning up other people's crap.
- Ow!
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Are you all right?
Guys, the truck's passing the Donahues'.
- Mom hit me with a beer bottle.
- What?
Brick, don't tell people that.
It sounds horrible.
Tossing it to Sue. Brick got in the way.
Let me see. No, you're fine.
- He's all right?
- Yeah. Barely even a scratch.
It's not bleeding or anything.
I'm sorry, honey.
Darn. But I wanted a Band-Aid.
Can I put a Band-Aid on anyway?
I want to use the Super Mario ones.
- [WHISPERING] Super Mario.
- Okay, that's fine, honey.
Mike, come on. We can do this.
We can do this. Hurry up.
We did it! We made...
The day started off lousy,
and then it got weird.
So out of the goodness of my heart,
I'm gonna reach into my own wallet...
...and instead of buying
that second pontoon boat...
...I'm gonna spend the money
on buying some TV ad time.
I decided to dust off my old commercial...
...from when we were
up to our jockstraps in good times.
Help! Help!
I'm being assaulted by high prices.
Just keep cool, little lady.
I'm Don Ehlert of Ehlert Motors...
...and they're not gonna get away
with that on my lot.
[GUNSHOTS]
I'm shooting down high prices.
[GRUNTS]
And bad service.
Mr. Ehlert, you can't run that commercial.
- It's racist.
- What are you talking about?
I'm shooting high prices.
It's racist to shoot high prices?
When high prices is a black man, yes, sir.
I just think maybe if you made
a new commercial...
...you might appeal
to an entirely new group of people...
...you know, young people, nonracists.
You two write me up a new commercial...
...and have it on my desk
tomorrow morning.
MAN [OVER PA]:
Frankie, you have a call on line one.
Your son Brick's school is on line one.
Well, I'm working too.
Besides, it's your turn.
I went to the school
when Axl pantsed the band kids.
- Sue and the squirrel attack.
- Brick and the chalk-chewing.
Brick and the lying down in class.
The beeping in class.
Brick and the howling in class.
Brick and the...
I'm Brick Heck's dad. What did he do
this time, forget his lunch?
We were in kind of a hurry this morning.
Thank you.
- What's going on here?
- You tell me.
I hear your wife got a little rough
with your son this morning.
What? Are you joking?
You guys strippers or something?
No, I'm afraid not.
We got a call from the hall monitor.
He said that your son told him...
...that his mother hit him
with a beer bottle.
Hi, Dad.
Guys, this is all
a huge misunderstanding.
- It was an accident.
- Relax, Mr. Heck. Just stay calm.
When parents are stressed,
lapses in judgment can occur.
FRANKIE: Tell me about it.
We should never have let Brick...
...anywhere near the first-aid kit.
[WHISTLING]
It's tiny. There's not even a scratch.
Brick, unwrap and show them.
Sir, we can't allow you
to talk directly to your son.
What?
- Is this for real?
FRANKIE: Oh, it was for real, all right.
It started with the bandage
and then just snowballed from there.
It didn't help that there was
a new hall monitor at school.
Hey, buddy, what happened to your arm?
- I'm not supposed to tell.
- What do you mean?
My mom says I'm not supposed to.
Well, if something happened at home,
you have to tell a grown-up.
Okay. My mom hit me with a beer bottle.
She was mad and my dad was mad,
and I always get in the way.
You can see how this sounded.
Everyone could see how it sounded,
except Brick.
Once a teacher
hears something like that...
...he's legally required to report it.
I realize this may be uncomfortable
for you to talk about, Mr. Heck...
...but has your wife
ever been physically abusive to you?
Are you kidding? She's 5 feet tall.
I could kick her ass.
- And do you ever kick her ass?
- No. No. Of course not.
- Mike. Got your message.
- Hi, honey. See how little she is?
Take your shoes off, hon.
Sorry, Mom.
You told me not to tell, but I told.
- Don't be mad.
- Mad? No.
Why would I be mad?
I am never mad, never, ever, ever.
This is a huge misunderstanding.
The beer bottle hit him
when I tossed it gently.
Just, oh, so gently.
And do you often drink in the morning?
No, that was my husband's beer bottle.
Mr. Heck, you're the one
who drinks in the morning?
No. God, this is ridiculous.
Look, hey, you know what?
We have a teenage son
that is a huge pain in the butt.
If we wanted to abuse somebody,
we would have abused him.
Officer McCoy,
if I could please step in here?
- I have known this family for years...
- Years and years and years.
They don't help with fundraisers...
- We work.
...or teacher-appreciation day...
...or the back-to-school picnic.
They are a good family.
Well, since the principal
feels so strongly about this...
...we'll release him
back into your custody.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Okay. So we're all done here?
Everything's cleared up?
No, you're in the system now.
A social worker will be coming by your
house to make an official evaluation.
You know those times you wished
someone would take your kids away?
Well, the reality isn't really as great
as the fantasy.
So the social worker's coming
tomorrow afternoon for the home visit.
If I tell the social worker
that you hit me too...
...does that mean I can trade up
to a better foster family?
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
They're gonna split us up!
They're gonna take us away!
Relax. Nobody's taking
anybody anywhere.
This is a formality
so they can sign their paperwork.
We're gonna answer questions.
Brick's gonna tell what happened.
And they're gonna see
what a normal family we really are.
Can I have dinner
here in my room tonight?
And at that moment, it dawned on us
that our future rested in Brick's hands.
God help us.
So, Brick, your dad and I thought
it might be fun to have a practice run...
...at some of the questions
the social worker might ask you.
- Sprinkles?
- Okay.
FRANKIE: There you go.
- So for example...
...what would you say if she asked
if your mom hits you?
- Not deliberately.
- Okay. That's a good answer.
But you know what's a good answer too?
"No." Just, "No."
"No" is good. Keep it brief, simple.
Okay. I'll just tell her
whatever you tell me I should say.
You wouldn't want her to think
that we're coaching you.
- But aren't you coaching me?
- What, this? No.
This isn't coaching.
No, we're just practicing.
Okay, so to recap...
...if she asks you
if we were coaching you...
...you would say...
- Yes.
Gosh, I think you could say no
for that question too.
- What do you think?
- I'm liking "no" as a go-to answer.
- So you're telling me to lie? Okay.
- No, no, no.
Nobody is telling you to lie.
I think we're just bending
the immediate truth...
...just a teeny, teeny bit...
...to get to the truth
that is the true truth.
- You understand?
- No.
- You don't?
- I don't know.
But you said no was my go-to answer.
- Can I go watch TV now?
- Sure.
- What do you think?
- I hope he goes to a nice family.
FRANKIE: Well, I wasn't the only one
stuck in a scary situation I didn't deserve.
All right, let's get this show on the road.
- Where's Frances?
- Actually, she had some family issues.
I know she's lied in the past and said
she had some family issues, but...
...this time she does.
- All right, let's kick this pig.
BOB:
Okay.
- Action.
- And down here, we've got... Damn it.
And down here, we've got...
What the hell is my hand doing?
Doesn't feel natural. I don't know
what to do with my damn hand.
And down here, we've got...
That's not right, is it?
And down... Oh, screw this.
What are you looking at?
Quiet!
Ehlert Motors,
where your every need will be...
[FLY BUZZES]
Where your every need will... Ah!
[CAR HORN HONKING]
This...
This is your fault.
The words you wrote are clumsy.
They don't roll off the tongue.
- Yeah, like this. What the hell is that?
- "Vehicle."
Yeah, that's fancy. I don't talk like that.
[FLY BUZZES]
Are you gonna help me,
or are you gonna stand there?
FRANKIE: The day
of the social-worker visit arrived...
...and we all pulled together
to make a good impression.
- How do I look?
- Take that off.
Damn it, Axl, take it off.
- Don't hit me.
- Not funny, Axl. Not funny.
[SUE WHIMPERS]
- Hey. Why are you crying?
- I'm just so scared.
Honey, I'm gonna give you a piece
of advice that my dad gave me once.
He said, "Son, stuff those feelings down.
Stuff them down,
and eventually they'll go away."
And I have not cried since.
What do you think?
Shades open or closed?
No. Closed looks like
we're hiding something. Open. Open.
The raccoons tore into the garbage
that never got picked up.
Sue, get out there and clean that up.
Okay, where is the Bible?
I wanna put it on the coffee table.
We don't have a real book anywhere.
Just People magazine.
Mike, quick, turn all the TVs to PBS.
- What channel is that?
- I don't know.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
She's here.
- Ohh! Ohh!
- You see? It's clean.
That's why I never wash the windows.
Oh, are you okay? Oh, my God.
Listen, you can't get a welt
on your head. Not now.
Okay, don't swell up, Sue. Don't swell.
What are we gonna do?
- It's very nice to meet you.
- It's very nice to meet you too.
Her head gets cold.
It's so nice to have you here, really.
- Yes, it's very nice.
- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
- No. That was your...
- No, I interrupted. It's my fault.
- Please, honey. You go.
- Thank you, dear.
- It's just nice to have you here.
- It really is.
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Oh, I'd love some herbal tea.
Oh, no. I don't have herbal tea.
I know it's good for you,
but I don't like it. I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry. I don't have herbal tea.
[SOBS]
Honestly, it's okay. Look, don't worry.
It's better if everyone
just stays relaxed, okay?
So I'm gonna need to speak with
each member of the family individually.
Great. That sounds great.
We're not nervous.
[CACKLES]
So how many hours a day would you say
you spend together as a family?
About every chance we get.
We love spending time together.
We're together all the time.
Two.
I don't know. What's the right answer?
What are foster families like?
Are there any with in-ground pools?
BARRY: Would you say that you
drink alcohol on a regular basis?
Oh, ho, ho, no, not at all. Hardly ever.
Three times a week.
More if the Colts are losing.
I just love my family so much.
Are there foster families available
with cute teenage girls?
Because they wouldn't be considered
my sisters, right?
BARRY:
Does your wife ever get angry?
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
BARRY: And what do you do
as a family for fun?
Biking, canoeing, visiting ancient
Native-American historical sites...
...and looking for arrowheads.
- Watch TV.
- Watch TV.
- Watch TV?
I don't know. Is that the right answer?
I just love my family so much.
Okay. Brick is up next.
FRANKIE:
Yep, our future was in his hands.
Brick, would you like to show me
to your room?
Okay.
Ahem!
Let me show you the room
that I share with my brother.
It wasn't going well for me...
...and it wasn't going well for Bob either.
It's Don Ehlert of Ehlert Motors.
Need a vehicle?
Got bad credit? We don't care.
Come on down.
We've got the lowest prices
south of Canada.
Follow the arrows.
Follow the signs to Ehlert Motors.
Mr. Ehlert, you did it. You made it
through the whole thing.
I did? Ha! I did.
Well, let me see it. Play it back.
EHLERT [OVER MONITOR]:
It's Don Ehlert of Ehlert Motors...
What the hell is this?
I don't look like that.
You made me look old and bald, and old.
No.
In my old commercial,
I was beautiful, Bob.
What'd you do to me?
Sir, well, you...
EHLERT:
Jackass.
It's been a long time.
Wonder how Brick's doing in there.
[SUE WHIMPERS]
Do not start to cry again, Sue.
I swear, I will...
BARRY: Thank you, Brick.
It was very nice to meet you too.
Oh, are you done already?
We were reading some Bible verses.
How did it go?
I told her everything that you told me
to... I mean, the truth.
I want to thank you all
for your honesty and candor.
I think I have everything I need,
so I will be contacting you shortly.
Uh, excuse me.
I know you can't tell us
anything official right now, but...
- I promise I won't tell.
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Heck.
I'm not able to discuss anything
at this time until I file my report.
I understand. Of course. So...
- It was lovely to meet you. Okay.
- Mm-hm.
It's funny, but,
you don't remember me, do you?
- Uh, should I?
- Well, we went out two or three times.
It was years ago.
Anyway, I really liked you,
but you never called me back.
Oh, well. It's nice to see you again.
- You dated our social worker?
- I don't even remember her. Oh, wait.
She could have been the one that liked
Duran Duran, always touching my face.
Man, she got old.
How could you not have called her?
What's wrong with her?
She's attractive. She's smart.
You should have called, Mike.
You should have called.
I didn't call her because I met you
and I liked you better.
Well, if this whole thing goes south,
it's on your head.
She doesn't seem the vindictive type.
Clearly, you know nothing about women.
Any scorned woman
would kill for this chance.
We are screwed.
FRANKIE: I tried to be as mellow as Mike,
but the truth is, I was a basket case.
[PHONE RINGING]
What if this chick was still mad at Mike
and was gonna take it out on us?
Damn it, I was gonna take some action.
WOMAN [OVER MACHINE]: You've
reached the offices of Social Services.
To schedule a hearing, press one.
To become a foster family, press two.
Hey, quick, everybody,
the new commercial's on.
WOMAN [ON TV]: Help! Help!
I'm being assaulted by high prices.
I'm shooting down high prices.
[GRUNTS]
[GROANS]
That's it?
That must have been easy.
I tried to go through proper channels,
but I couldn't wait any longer.
Mike might not have pursued her,
but I sure was gonna.
Hi. I'd like to see Carol Barry, please.
Is she expecting you?
Is anyone ever really expecting anyone?
And should we be?
I mean,
isn't being surprised the most fun?
So that's a no.
No appointment, no seeing.
- Now, you can call our 1-800 number...
- No, you can't, because I tried, and...
- Can I just use your bathroom?
- Employees only.
Oh, I... Nervous bladder.
I have a doctor's note.
Go. Go.
Ms. Barry?
BARRY:
Yes?
Hi. It's Frankie Heck.
Hi. May I help you?
Well, I just wanted to explain...
...why my husband Mike
never called you back.
I mean, I'm sure you have been
wondering about it all these years...
...because clearly you are lovely
and he liked you. He really did.
It's just that the timing
just wasn't right, because, you see...
...we met going up to the Indy 500,
and, well...
To tell you the truth...
...I slept with him on the second date,
which I never really do.
But you know, I was a nice girl then.
As were you...
...I mean, obviously,
because you didn't put out.
And good for you.
So I just hope that all of this
doesn't make you think differently...
...about my family, because...
- Frankie...
[TOILET FLUSHES]
...I got over your husband
a long time ago.
Thank God.
Well, you should count your blessings...
...because believe me
he really is no picnic to live with.
But he's a good dad.
Oh, such a great dad.
Frankie, I'm not supposed to tell you
any information...
...until the report is filed.
- But you're fine.
- We are?
Do you have any idea the kind of crazy
families I see in my job?
Trust me, meeting yours was
the best part of my week, my month.
- Really?
- Really.
As soon as I file my report
with my supervisor...
...your case will be officially closed
and then you can go on with your life.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
I promise you I will not bother you again.
FRANKIE:
Actually, that was a lie.
I couldn't go home
without actually seeing it in writing.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
I don't think I ever knew
what relief meant until that moment.
There was an upside
to all that happened, though.
I had written proof
that I was a good parent...
...and believe me, it came in handy.
Whoa, I cannot believe
that you won't let me go car skiing.
It's safe. There's a spotter car
that follows right behind.
Oh, my God. You are the worst mom ever.
Really?
The state of Indiana seems to disagree.
Yep. It was good to have it in writing.
