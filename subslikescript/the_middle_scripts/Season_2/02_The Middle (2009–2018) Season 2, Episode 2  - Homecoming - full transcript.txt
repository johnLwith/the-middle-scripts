Out here in the middle,
fall means a lot of things...
Crunchy leaves, hayrides,
and, most importantly,
homecoming.
It's the one day of the year...
the whole town
stops watching football inside...
and starts watching it outside.
And this year promised
to be extra special.
Axl made varsity.
How 'bout this kid?
Oh, my gosh. Axl!
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
Uh, gross. You know the rules.
Christmas and birthdays only.
Fine. I'll hug your dad.
Still gross.
Truth is,
I wasn't just happy for axl.
You see,
when your son's on varsi,
you get to escort him
onto the field...
before the big homecoming game,
and it makes all the other crap
you go through worthwhile,
'cause no matter
how smart-mouthy and horrible...
your k is
every other day of the year,
for one shining moment you've
got everyone watching you,
wondering...
What did she do right?
And you're
the only one who knows.
Nothing.
Look, just try not
to embarrass me, okay?
Yep, warm mother-son moments
with axl...
were few and far between
these days,
and I was sure as hell gonna
enjoy this one.
Okay. I need your vote.
Which one should I wear
to homecoming?
Which one's cheaper?
Mike, this is homecoming. I'm
not gonna worry about money.
I'll tuck the price tag in and
return it the next day. Thattagirl.
I can't tell. Until it's
filled up, it's just clothes.
Besides, it's not gonna matter
what you decide to wear anyway,
'cause all eyes are gonna be on this.
Oh, is that right?
'Fraid so. Well, it may be competing
with cleavage, so good luck.
Mm. Oh, look at that.
I gotta get somebody...
out there wi rake. Well, axl's at
football, and sue's at cross-country.
Oh, but I hed Molly donahue has...
a little leaf-raking business going.
Why would I pay someone else's kid...
when I got a perfectly good
free one over there,
sitting under our roof, eating our food,
using our last name? Have you met Brick?
He's not ready for leaf-raking.
He can't even blow his nose.
No.
You're... you're sucking in.
Out. Out. Blow out.
No. Wait. Close your mouth.
Gotta get some pressure
going there. Ooh.
This is nuts.
When I was 8, my dad had me
drivin' a tractor,
tarrin' a roof, trimmin'
a tree with a chainsaw.
And remember, we were gonna
try and do better.
I'm just sayin', Brick's
been playing the baby card...
for a little too long.
Chores are part of being a man.
Brick, congratulations.
You've been called up.
You're going to the show.
Because I don't know what that means,
I'm gonna assume it's some kind
of sports expression.
I got a job for you, son.
I want you to go out there...
and rake all the leaves in the backyard. Oh...
I don't think I'm ready for leaf-raking,
but thanks for your confidence.
Confidence.
Come on. Let's go.
All right. Rake works better if you
flip it around.
There ya go. He's got it.
Look
what I got at practice today...
My cross-country phone tree,
my cross-country schedule,
and my cross-country
sportsmanship agreement,
which I have to sign
and return.
Wow. There's so many papers
to sign when you're on a sport.
You just stick that schedule
up on the cupboard, girl.
I finally have something
to put on the cupboard...
besides my braces tightening
schedule.
I guess I'll just have to move
axl's football schedule over.
After all,
we do have two athletes
in the family now.
First meet is on the 2nd.
How can sue's first meet be
on the same day as homecoming?
What kind of team
schedules something...
the same day as homecoming?
It doesn't make any sense.
Right? I mean, come on.
Axl finally makes varsity.
Sue finally makes...
Anything!
And they're both
at the same time?
Why does the universe
do this to us?
The universe took a look at als...
and had to take us down a peg.
Yeah, well...
We got two events, two parents.
We'll just have to divide
and conquer, I guess.
Ugh. All right.
I'll take football.
Wh... no way.
Why do you get football?
I'm a guy. Oh, come on.
Cross-country's a sport, too.
Is it? They run into the woods
and come out two hours later.
Lost dogs do the same thing.
I want homecoming!
It's a huge deal.
I bought a new dress
and everything.
Well, technically you didn't.
Oh, no way, Mike. No way.
Let's shoot for it.
Rock, paper, scissors. Come on.
Rock... I'm not gonna shoot you for it.
Rock, paper, scissors.
Ready?
Rock, paper, scissors. Come... wrong.
Rock, paper, scissors. No. All right. Hold on.
Come on. We're being silly.
Homecoming is the bigger deal.
We're expected to walk axl
out on the field.
We have a job.
That's our job.
Sue has a whole season of meets
we can go to. She'll be fine.
And it's her first meet. I don't
want to miss her first meet.
Well, then I guess
we have our answer.
No, we do not have our answer.
I want to walk axl out
on the field.
Ohh. I want to do both.
Oh, God. I feel sick.
Okay, stop beatin' yourself up.
Sue!
She's a big girl.
She'll understand. Sue!
Yeah?
I'm sorry, but your first meet
is at the same time...
as the big homecoming game,
so...
Oh. That's okay. You don't
have to come to my meet.
I mean...
Mom'll be there.
Brick.
Use the rake.
The rake, Brick.
So while Mike was dealing
with Brick,
i was trying to forget
about homecoming,
which, for some reason,
was not easy.
How do I look, Bob?
Actually, sir, I think
you're supposed to drive,
and the homecoming queen
sits back there.
Does the homecoming queen
own a car dealership...
and two pawnshops?
I'm the big dog around here!
I can sit wherever I want.
Wow. Homecoming, huh?
It's a pretty big deal.
I know. Huge.
Yeah.
I'm a little worried
about axl, though, you know?
I mean, this is
a big deal for him,
and I'll be with you instead.
Oh, don't worry
about axl, mom.
He understands
things are different...
now that
I'm on cross-country.
I mean, you've gone
to hundreds of his events,
and you've never gone to
a single one of mine ever...
And now you get to.
Aah!
That is so true! Aah!
Mom, it means a lot to me
that I can finally be...
the one to make you proud.
Are those tears of joy
in your eyes?
Tears are tears.
We don't have to define them.
...
Ow! ...
So, listen,
I'm really sorry I'm gonna
have to miss homecoming.
Whatevs.
Are you okay?
'Cause if you're upset
about this,
maybe you should tell sue.
Just, you know,
tell her how you wanted me...
to walk you onto that field
your whole life...
and you'll be
really disappointed...
if you have to go out there
without me.
Okay. Well, first of all,
maybe you're right
that I'll be disappointed,
but I don't think so,
and, second of all, no.
Well, why don't you just
get up off the couch...
and yell something, like,
"my, God, mom!
"It would break my heart
that my very own mother...
won't be at
the biggest day of my life!"...
Then storm into your room, and I'll do the rest.
Ugh.
Okay, you don't have
to say "disappointed."
You can put it
in your own words.
"Crushed," "bogus," "lame-o"...
Whatever feels comfortable.
What's that smirk about?
I got you an ely birthday gift.
Well, you didn't get me
anything last year,
so technically it's late,
but what do you got?
I took care of it.
I talked to sue's coach...
and got him
to move cross-country...
a half-hour earlier so you can do both.
You're welcome. Oh, my God! Mike! How?
There's not much you can't
accomplish in this town...
with a case of beer
and a wheel of cheese.
Oh, seriously? I can do both?
I can really do both?
Oh! You are a hero.
At's the word I was gonna use.
See, I'm a doer, Frankie.
While you talk, talk, talk,
I get it done.
Talker. Doer. Just like
this thing with Brick.
I put him outside
and told him to work.
That out there is
a man in the making.
Yeah, well,
your man in the making...
just climbed into a trash bag.
Jeez. Brick!
Come on. Get out of there.
Thattaboy. He's out.
And so Brick continued
to rake the leaves...
day after day after day.
He organized them by color.
He made sure he got every one.
It's almost ready!
He did his job...
with extraordinary attention
to detail.
This one doesn't match
any of our trees.
I'll return it
to the neighbors.
And just when Mike had
about given up...
I finished.
Really?
Yep.
Oh.
You did it.
Took you 11 days to do a job
that should take an hour,
but you did it. All by yourself.
Doesn't it feel good? It really does.
You're growing up fast,
Brick. Really fast.
I know.
Can you tie my shoe?
At last, the big day arrived.
Homecoming was our super bowl.
Actually, the super bowl was
our super bowl,
but homecoming was
a close second.
Ah, ya flooded it,
you dizzy broad.
Now we're screwed.
Well, don't just sit there.
Get out and push.
B-e a-g-g-r-e-s-s-I-v-e!
Aggressive! B-e aggressive!
Whoo!
Hey!
Mike.
Brickster.
Oh, Bob.
Ah.
You found us.
Great game, huh?
Yeah, we're gonna crush them
to smithereens.
Orson rules!
Yeah!
Ah-ooh-gah! Ow! Ow!
Yeah, baby! Whoo!
You're really going
to town there, huh?
Oh. Sorry about that.
That's okay.
Yeah, you know,
big weekend for an alum.
Gettin' fired up.
Gettin' psyched. Ah!
Oh, the times I had here.
You didn't go here.
No. I was homeschooled.
Where's Frankie?
Um...
Where was I?
I was at a place...
that people from the boonies
refer to as the sticks.
Runners, on your mark.
Go, sue! Whoo!
Go, sue! Yeah!
Go, sue!
Have you er seen
such pageantry?
And the thundering hens
drill rifle-ettes are up next,
as soon as we get
the stalled car moved...
off the field.
Uh, yeah, sorry... the stalled
car from ehlert motors!
So when you think of quality,
think ehlert motors!
Yeah!
Go, thundering hens!
Whoo!
Bob, when they say
"yards rushing,"...
what does that mean?
Well, football's a really
fascinating game, Brick.
It's hard to explain
all the particular nuances.
You don't know, do you?
I just cheer when everyone else does.
Dad, then can I ask you
a question?
Kinda wondering why you didn't.
Okay. Where do the leaves go,
you know, after the raking?
You ask Bob about football
and I get leaves?
Well? Well, we'll take 'em down
to the dump, and they'll put 'em...
in the incinerator. What?!
You never said they were gonna burn 'em!
Well, what did you think was gonna happen?
I thought maybe we'd take them into the forest...
and set them free.
Will all varsity parents
please report to the field?
Okay. Look, Brick, I don't
have time to talk to you...
about this now. They're calling
the parents down onto the field.
Hey, Bob. Keep an eye on him till I get back.
No problem, Mike.
He's safe with me. I'm going
for a corn dog. Save my seat.
In just a short time,
we'll begin the parade...
...Of
the Orson varsity families.
I think it's safe to assume
at least some of these parents...
had sons
expressly for this purpose.
Hi. I'm sue heck's mom, and
she hasn't come in yet. Who?
Never mind. I was just
wondering if you know...
when this'll be wrapping up,
because I need
to get to homecoming.
It's kind of a big deal,
'cause my son's on varsity.
Ah, football. Everyone loves
the sports with balls.
Look, everyone else is in,
so I guess it'll be over...
when your daughter crosses
over the finish line.
Okay.
Where is she?
Oh, my God.
I don't see anyone
in front of me.
Oh!
I think I'm first!
Hey, sue. Lookin' good.
Mom.
What are you doing here?
How's my time?
Am I winning?
Oh. Not exactly. The other
runners have all come in.
Oh, really? Well, I lost
some time in the woods.
An angry raccoon wouldn't
let me stay on the path,
and I fell into a pricker bush,
and it took a while to get out.
And then I threw up a little.
But I think I'm on a runner's high now.
Hey, listen, sue.
Why don't you hop in? I'll
drive you to the finish line.
What?! I can't do that.
That's cheating. It's not cheating.
You'll still get last place.
You'll just get it sooner.
It's time, mom.
They record your time.
No, honey, but see,
the... the timekeeper left.
She went to homecoming.
They all went
to hecoming.
I'm sorry, but I want
to cross that finish l...
sue heck does not give up.
And that is what I love about you. I really do.
Just not when I have
15 minutes to get to homecoming...
and walk your brother out
onto that field!
I knew it. I knew you'd rather
be at axl's thing than with me.
Okay, you know what, sue?
You got me.
Yes, I want to go
to axl's thing.
I want to wear
a pretty, returnable dress...
and walk your brother
down the field,
but not because I don't want to
be here with you, because I do.
And I was! It's just that
I get no affection from axl.
I mean, you're a girl,
and you still love to hug...
and cuddle with me,
but your brother is just...
this miserable, smart-mouthed
pain in the butt...
who won't let me
anywhere near him,
and if I can have one moment
where he'll let me...
walk arm in arm with him
out onto that field...
and kiss him on the cheek,
and he can't wipe it off,
then yes!
I wanted to do that!
Okay.
Let's go get your moment.
You gotta love daughters.
We even found a way for sue
to cross the finish line.
Aah!
I can't get ahold of her.
...And number 32,
escorted
by frances and Michael heck.
I'm here. I'm here.
Oh, thank God. Mom, I was afraid
you weren't gonna make it.
Here.
Yeah, here's
what really happened.
...
And now each boy will pin his mother...
with the traditional
homecoming corsage.
The corsages were donated
by al's hardware,
your discount snow shovel
destination!
Al's hardware...
Where the sale never ends!
Sale ends Friday.
Here.
Oh. Yeah, okay.
And so that was it.
I had missed the big moment.
I missed it all... the pageantry,
the walk, the corsage.
But then,
almost as if axl wanted
to make it up to me,
he pulled off
the greatest play of the year.
What's happening?
I don't know!
Whoo, axl!
Yes!
We have a time-out
on the field...
with number 32 down
at the 11 yard line.
He's okay. Hjust got
the wind knocked out of him.
Frankie?
Frankie, no!
Dude, your mom's here.
Good evening, Mrs. heck.
Lovely dress.
Axl, sweetie, are you okay?
Please tell me I'm dead.
God, I can't
believe she just did that.
The good news is, I did get
to walk arm in arm on the field...
with my son, but it wasn't
exactly how I had pictured it.
Well, if you wanted
to wait 16 years...
until the perfect moment
to completely destroy my life...
so I can never show my face
outside this house again,
congratulations, mom!
Your evil plan worked! Axl.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I still don't understand.
Where is it written
that a mother cannot run...
out onto a football field if
she thinks her son is injured?
It's not written anywhere,
Frankie,
'cause everyone
in the world agreed...
it was too obvious to write down.
Well, I think axl is being a baby.
Embarrassment is
an important part of sports.
My coach told me that.
Dad?
What, Brick?
If we can't set the leaves
free,
can I at least keep them
in my room?
They won't take up much space.
Space.
No, Brick. You're not
settin' 'em free,
you're not keeping 'em
in your room,
and you're not reading to 'em.
They'r not your friends, Brick.
They're leaves.
Dead leaves. You got it?
I just don't get it.
When's that kid gonna grow up?
Why are you in such a hurry
for him to grow up?
So he can, quick,
be a teenager like axl...
and have nothing to do with us?
Don't wish the time away, Mike.
Hey.
Brought you an ice pack
for your shoulder.
Just...
Keep it there for 20 minutes.
But don't fall asleep
with it on, 'cause...
I'm sorry. Sorry.
It's just...
Hard to stop being a mom.
Listen, I know
you're growing up,
and... and you want me
out of your life,
and I'm trying, axl.
I really am.
It's just that it's gone
so darn fast, you know?
Like warp speed.
A minute ago,
you were hanging on my leg,
begging me not to leave you
at preschool,
and now I realize,
I shouldn't have.
I should've just
snatched you and ran.
And, you know,
all I'm trying to say...
is that if I embarrassed you...
by running out
onto that football field...
Which I still don't see
why it's so wrong, ut I'm...
Then...
I'm sorry.
Good night.
Don't have to stop.
What?
I-I mean,
he hit me really hard,
you know.
It kinda hurts.
I guess that's the thing
about being a mom.
You never really have to stop.
You just have to start learning
to do it in private,
but that's okay.
In the end, it's not about
those big, public moments.
It's the little moments...
The ones that sneak up on you.
Those are the ones
you remember.
Ah.
This is
harder than I thought.
I know.
