Three days of spring break,
that's all we tried to enjoy.
Visit my sister, hit the water park...
... I even remembered
to tell Nancy Donahue...
... to bring in our mail for once.
Just three days.
But, no.
Frankie, I'm so sorry to tell you this.
You've been robbed.
Your whole house has been ransacked.
Can't believe we got robbed.
What kind of stupid robbers
would rob us?
I hope they didn't steal my books.
What about
my cross-country sweatshirt?
- I should have brought it.
- lf they stole books and your sweatshirt...
...they're the nerdiest robbers ever.
Oh, my God. My nunchucks.
The important thing is we're safe.
Let's just all calm down...
...until we figure out
what we're dealing with.
Oh.
I'm so sorry. I came to bring in
your Us Weekly...
...and instead, I brought you tragedy.
It's just so horrible.
It was horrible, because truth is...
... the house looked exactly the same
as when we left it.
I'm sorry you had to see
your house this way, folks.
These animals have no regard
for human decency.
- But it looks exactly...
- Don't scream. It's okay.
We still have each other.
Keep track of what's missing
for the insurance report.
Oh, no. They took my box of money.
And my Ferrari. It was red. No, black. No.
Red with black seats.
Glad you still got your sense of humor.
That's something no one can steal.
Anyway, we'll keep an eye out
for your things.
Thanks. We'd appreciate that.
But don't take any time out
from solving murders for it.
As captain of the neighborhood watch,
I feel like I've let you down.
Uh, no, Nancy.
The only ones to blame here...
...are the evil, disgusting
lowlifes who did this.
Oh, no. That wasn't too embarrassing.
That's it. We're pigs.
It's spring. We're cleaning.
I just don't know how it got this bad.
Starving.
A box? Okay.
This is the second-worst breakfast
you've ever made.
- It's for cleaning.
- What? You were serious?
It's spring break.
Supposed to be chilling hard-core.
Chilling hard-core for 20 years
is what let all this junk pile up.
I mean, the police had to come.
We're criminally messy.
Cops are looking
for the people who did this.
Technically, we're on the lam, so hop to.
I was gonna go
to the copy store...
...and copy my books
in case we do get robbed.
By the way, I need 50,000 quarters.
Okay, this is gonna be
way easier than we think.
If we all work together, we're gonna
be relaxing in a clean house by lunch.
- Now let's start cleaning up the crap.
- Everything we own is crap.
Crap we use and crap we don't use.
We're gonna be heartless. If you haven't
touched it in a year, toss it.
Oprah says, "We need to live
for the life we're living today."
Be heartless. Got it.
We can't use this box for garbage.
This is the box my high chair came in.
Pay attention to the box names, people.
The inflatable footbath is not "Keep."
It's "Charity."
And the needy
have enough problems...
...without drinking
our expired cough syrup.
Aw. It's Brick's second grade diorama.
Aw.
Mom, how can you
just throw that out?
It's a beloved memento
from your youngest son's childhood.
Brick, you remember
your diorama, right?
Yeah.
Attaboy, Brick. Way to be heartless.
Mike, what are you doing?
You can't put your coffee mug
on the table.
It's a clean zone now.
It's been inoculated.
The one mug, one magazine,
one backpack...
...is permission for the whole thing
to go south again.
Oh, that's nuts.
Me putting my mug down is not gonna...
My bed's done.
You had all these in your room,
and you still watched me...
...eat pot roast out of a measuring cup
last night?
Uh, you think you might need
this biology book tomorrow?
Ha, spring break.
No school tomorrow. Burn.
What about next week?
I'm living for the life I'm living today.
Axl. You're really gonna give away
the "Best Brother Oscar" I gave you?
You beat out Brick for it.
It was an honor just to be nominated.
One word. Buddha-ism.
I don't need things.
I can walk away
from all this in a heartbeat.
Even you guys. I'll wander the earth
as a peaceful nomad doing good deeds.
Dude, Mom, it's 3:00
and I'm still starving.
You said we'd be done by now
and it's getting worse.
I can't make anybody lunch
if I can't get to the fridge, now can I?
I say we clear one path to the fridge...
...and one to the bathroom and call it.
You're right. This isn't working.
You know what we're gonna do?
We're going full Oprah.
Everything goes outside in the yard.
Nothing comes back
unless you convince me...
...that you truly love it and need it.
- Sue, go outside.
- Mom.
As always, Oprah was right.
Things were starting
to look a little better...
... inside.
Yep, I'm sure this is how
Oprah spends her Sundays too.
Where do you want this thing?
I found M-80s. Let's blow it up.
Just put it on the curb.
Somebody will take it.
Excuse me. I'm looking for Oak Street.
Oh, okay. What you wanna do
is turn left at the sign...
...go three blocks, veer right,
then make the second left.
Thanks.
Hey, I got a history test coming up.
Who was Abraham Lincoln's
vice president?
Actually, he had two.
Hannibal Hamlin,
then Andrew Johnson...
...who became president
after Lincoln was assassinated.
Sweet. Thanks.
Tell your friends.
Hey.
Did Mom say you could bring those in?
Did Mom say you could eat
that candy bar?
I found it under the couch.
Why do you need those curlers?
They're broken anyway.
I've had them since fourth grade.
What, are you afraid you're gonna hurt
their feelings if you throw them out?
What? I was kidding. Oh, my God.
- Sue thinks her curlers have feelings.
- I don't.
- Really? What if I did this?
- No, no. Oh...
- Stop it. You're scaring it.
- Scaring it?
My God.
This just gets better and better.
- No. Axl, give them back right now.
- Hey. Stop. Stop.
You can save one.
Which one will it be, Sue?
This one?
- Or this one?
- Please don't make me choose.
Look, I know it's silly...
...but I used to put them in my hair
in a different order each time...
...so that none of them felt left out.
Oh.
I'm sorry, Sue. I didn't know
you were out of your freaking mind.
- Ugh! God, Axl.
- Hey, guys, stop standing around.
Come on now.
There's no time for talking.
If we focus, we can finish by dinner.
It's midnight. I'm calling this thing.
Everybody in. We'll finish tomorrow.
But what if somebody takes our stuff?
Then we'd be lucky.
But nobody took anything.
In fact, we woke up the next
morning to even more stuff.
A cat carrier? We never had a cat.
Other people are dumping their stuff.
And we didn't finish that day either.
After people started dumping,
we moved the stuff from the yard...
... back into the family room.
On third day, it moved into the kitchen.
By the fourth day,
we all went a little crazy.
We are never gonna
get rid of all this stuff.
You know what we have to do?
Get rid of ourselves.
Seriously. We'll just walk away
and live in a van.
Yeah, we'll just travel
around the country...
...and learn about each other
and barter for things and food...
...and not fill our lives
with possessions...
...fill our van with love.
But this being America,
in times of tragedy...
... there's always someone
making a buck off of it.
So to get the full cardio benefit
at your age and weight...
...your target heart rate should be 137
for about 20 minutes.
I.U. has about 32,000 undergrads,
while Notre Dame only has eight.
Thanks.
Hi, I have that information
for you about Tupperware.
If you wanna call me back,
I'll be here till 5.
Then I have to take a bath.
Next.
If you're not gonna support
my van plan...
...clear the stuff off the bed
so we have some place to sleep.
Hey, all this crap is your stuff,
not mine.
All I got is maybe six things
in that box over there.
- I'm van-ready all the time.
- Ooh.
Mike only has six things.
What do you want? A medal?
Sure. Give it to me, I'll throw it away.
Let me just see what six things
made it into your special box.
Oh.
Floorboard from the I.U. Assembly hall
I gave you for Father's Day. That's nice.
Sports illustrated from when the Colts
won the Super Bowl. Okay.
"Pro-con: Riding lawn mower."
What's this?
Oh, that's my decision list.
I do one for every big decision
I gotta make.
"Pro: 25 horsepower.
Con: Less exercise."
- You actually kept this?
- Sure.
That way I can look at it
in case I wanna get another mower.
Really? That's so cute.
Aw. "Pro-con: Deck sealant,
Pro-con: Blender.
Pro-con: Marry Frankie"?
Oh, yeah. Ha-ha-ha.
Uh-oh.
Seriously, Mike? You made
a pro and con list about marrying me?
You know, you should be flattered
that I took the time to mull it over.
A woman doesn't want
to be mulled over, Mike.
She wants to think her husband
just went with his heart.
And how many things you bought with
your heart are we throwing out right now?
No, no. Pro-con. That's how I do things.
That's my system.
Okay. Fine. Let's see why
you wanted to marry me, hmm?
"Pro number one: Tax break."
Tax break?
It's an all-inclusive list
in no particular order.
"Number two: Likes Reservoir Dogs."
Well, we both know that's a lie.
"Three: Pretty."
"Four: Great at..."
You didn't finish this one.
What am I great at?
- Letting things go?
- There's only four pros on this list.
Actually, it's only three and a half...
...because the last one, you didn't finish,
and there's 15 cons.
- I said you were pretty.
- "Cons."
Oh, let's not do this.
- "Chatty."
- That was back when I thought...
...I had to listen to everything you said.
- "Loud"?
That comes in handy
for yelling at the kids.
All right. I'll give you that one. "Cries"?
Gotta be honest with you,
still not a fan.
"The wine dance"?
It's called seduction, Mike.
Look, this was you 20 years ago.
It's got nothing to do with you today,
so let's give it here.
No, no, no. Let's keep reading. I'm really
having fun learning how you think.
"Good mother, question mark"?
But now we know that you are one...
...so let's just turn
that question mark into an arrow...
...and send it over to the pros.
Or even better...
...we're trying to get rid of stuff.
Let's get rid of the list.
Oh, no. I think you should keep it...
...just in case
you ever wanna get another wife.
Word in the park says
you can answer any question.
I was headed to lunch,
but I got 30 seconds.
What's your question?
Why are my parents getting a divorce?
Guys, come on.
I told you to take this stuff
to the donation place hours ago.
Sue's fault. She's going
back and forth on those curlers.
- She thinks they're alive.
- I didn't say they're alive.
I said they have feelings.
I know they don't. It's just...
I can't get rid of them
because then they might feel bad.
Which is ridiculous
because they don't have feelings.
I just don't want them
to feel abandoned, you know?
Well, Sue, don't think
of it as abandoning them.
You're donating them.
And somewhere out there
is a homeless man with straight hair...
...who will use these to curl his locks,
get a job and change his life.
Really? Okay. Heh.
Quick, run these to the car
before she changes her mind.
Meanwhile, Brick was a bit thrown
by the question from his latest client...
... but Brick being Brick,
he turned to the wisdom of the ages.
My arm is killing me.
Why couldn't we just tie this down?
Wait for it.
Tada!
Automatic unload.
Oh, no. Closed.
Gonna have to load
everything back up.
No way. Let's just dump and run.
But the sign says,
"Do not leave items after hours."
There's no way
we're carting this crap back.
Stop wussing out and help me.
Do not leave items after hours.
Oh, no. They're watching us.
- Chill. It's just a recording.
- This is not just a recording.
You. Boy with the red tricycle,
girl with the straight hair...
... it is illegal to leave items
after hours...
... per Indiana penal code 35-45,
section 3.
I'm sorry. It's just...
We've come all this way and...
Screw him. We're done. Let's blow.
We're really good kids. I promise.
Oh, no. I was gonna leave a note
for whoever got the curlers.
You have to jiggle the plug.
You have to jiggle the plug.
Full house down there. Maybe we can jam
these boxes in the attic.
Yeah. Well, I'm almost done up here.
Ooh. Uh-oh.
What's this? Huh. "Pro-con: Mike."
Is that thing still bugging you?
What? No. I just found this.
I must have made this years ago.
It's on the back of Brick's report card
from last week.
Fine. Whatever.
Look, I might have some flaws...
...but believe me,
you're no Brian Williams.
Let's take a little look-see at some
of your many, many cons.
"One: Freakishly tall.
Two: Can't hit the toilet."
That's part of being tall.
"Three: Mean in the morning.
Four: List maker.
Five: Your version of the wine dance.
'You up?"'
Okay, Frankie, you made your point.
Wait. You wanna hear your pros?
"One: Absolutely amazing
and fantastic at..."
Oops, I left it blank,
and now I can't remember...
...what you're absolutely amazing
and fantastic at.
Frankie, it's a stupid paper
from 20 years ago. Let it go.
Let it go? The blender
has more pros than me.
Well, the blender crushes ice
and turns off when I want it to.
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
Am I being too chatty?
Look, it's crazy that you even had
to make a list to decide...
...to marry me in the first place,
considering...
Considering what?
Considering who you were back then...
...the level of women you dated.
Let's just say you were pretty lucky
to land me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you saying I married up?
And Bingo was his name-o.
Oh, and you got nothing
out of this deal?
I got something. I got a lifetime...
...full of toenail clippings
in my People magazine.
Hang on. Your list was based
on 18 years of marriage.
Mine's from six months of dating.
We're allowed to go there? I'll go there.
- Then go there.
- I'm not going there.
Axl, did you hear that?
They're coming to arrest us.
- For what?
- Penal code 35-45, section 3.
- We need to get our story straight.
- Okay. Here's the story.
We went to donate to charity
and we did.
Hope we don't get the chair.
But the sign, and the voice.
Oh, that voice, it haunts me.
- We should tell Mom and Dad.
- Nothing to tell.
Except that spring break
was a major suck fest.
Well, just so you know,
whatever happens, I got your back.
I'd love to talk to you more...
...but my stapler's feeling
pretty left out...
...so I gotta go
spend some time with it.
You absolutely do that.
You do it all the time.
Do you ever stop to think
that maybe I'm busy doing something?
Like vacuuming the family room
for Sue's birthday...
...so that we won't be embarrassed?
You're worried about being embarrassed
in front of girls...
...but you're not by the cement geese
on our porch.
They're whimsical.
They're not
when I smashed into them...
...with my feet and I'm hopping around
bleeding, trying to find a Band-Aid.
Well, buy a Band-Aid
for once in your life.
You never buy Band-Aids.
You never buy anything.
I buy Band-Aids,
but they're never the right kind.
The cheap ones that float off
in the tub and clog the drain.
What do you know about the drain?
Do you even know where the wrench is?
Where's the wrench, Frankie?
If I knew where the wrench is,
what do I need you for?
- Mom. Dad.
- What?
Why do people get divorced?
Oh, honey, sweetie.
We're not getting divorced.
No, your Dad and I love each other
very much. See?
Yeah, Brick. Your Mom and I
aren't really fighting.
Oh, I wasn't asking about you guys.
It's for work.
But I see you're busy.
Ooh! This is Brick's report card.
We have to sign it
and send it back to school.
See, that's why you shouldn't go
digging up the past.
Dust flies, stuff gets uncovered,
things get said.
And some things
are just better buried and forgotten.
I'll get it.
Hi, officers. What's going on?
Good news, Mrs. Heck.
We found your stuff.
The criminals just dumped it all
in an alley.
The criminals who robbed us.
Heh. Remember, Mom?
Some of it
was labeled with your name.
It's a slow day, so we loaded up
a few cruisers and brought it all back.
Hey, guys.
All of it? That's just great.
So that's the thing about divorce.
Some couples rush into marriage...
...without really thinking about
the pros and cons.
Others just grow apart.
In the case of Scarlett Johansson
and Ryan Reynolds...
...it was distance and egos.
Thanks,
but I actually came to tell you...
...I misheard my parents
when I was listening through the wall.
They're not getting a divorce.
They're getting me a horse.
Arabian or quarter horse?
Because Arabians
need a much bigger paddock.
Paddock.
