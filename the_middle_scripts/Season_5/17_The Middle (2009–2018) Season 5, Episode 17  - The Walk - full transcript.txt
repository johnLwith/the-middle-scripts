[ Crow caws ]
Everyone has
a date to the prom but me.
I am the only one.
Sue, I'm sure you're not
the only one.
- No, I am. It's true.
- [ Sighs ]
You know, I heard that Beyoncé
never got asked to her prom.
Really?
Frankie:
I had no idea if that was true.
I mean,
it's certainly possible.
You don't come out of the womb
lookin' like Beyoncé.
She could've been awkward
in high school.
What kind of name is "Beyoncé"?
Is it French or did her parents
just make it up?
Oh, I wish
I could speak French.
God knows when I'd use it.
But still, sometimes it's just
nice to be able to do stuff.
[ Speaking indistinctly ]
Oh, my God. Your daughter is
pouring out her heart to you.
Listen! Focus!
Pay attention!
That is something
I've never told anyone ever.
Uh-oh.
She stopped talking.
Say something.
Take a shot.
Honey, I'm sure you will.
[ Gasps ]
Oh. Thanks, mom.
God, I'm good.
Axl, did you have Mrs. Danner
for sixth-grade English?
[ Grunts ] Grandma arms,
slight mustache?
Yeah, I remember her.
Well, she won't let us write
a normal book report --
says we have to be creative
and "Think outside the book."
I hate this.
If they want us to think
outside the box,
they should tell us
exactly how.
Oh, yeah, I remember
that project.
I did awesome on that.
So you'll help me with mine?
No, I was just telling you
how awesome I am.
Hey, who helped you
drop all those classes
so you wouldn't fail
out of school?
And who allowed himself
to be farted on
for the promise of a prize
that never came?
As far as little brothers go,
you hit the jackpot.
So, come on,
help a brother out.
Sue, I need to talk to you
for a minute.
Enjoy your potato.
Oh, no.
Am I over-chiving again?
No, it's not about the chives.
Although, you know
with the chives, less is more.
This is non-work related.
I'm gonna take off
my assistant-manager hat.
I'm gonna talk to you
as a fellow student
of Orson High --
and a man.
Anyway, I would like you
to accompany me to the prom.
Really?
[ Laughs ]
Yes!
I'm going to prom!
[ Chuckles ]
Whoo!
[ Laughs ]
Now back to work.
Yes.
Dr. Oz says
sitting is the new smoking,
so Mike and I decided to
haul our butts off the couch
and take a walk.
And while we may no longer
be dying from sitting,
dying from boredom
was definitely a possibility.
[ Yawns ]
But then something amazing
happened -- well, someone.
Well, someones.
I'm saying
we ran into other people.
Hey! Vicki
from Mrs. Keats' class.
Remember we sat next to each
other at back to school night?
Yeah, thanks so much for
waking me up when I fell asleep.
[ Laughs ]
No problem.
Hey, this is my husband, Mike.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
This is my husband, Dale.
Hey, I'm Dale.
[ Indistinct conversation ]
[ Sue and Dale laugh ]
So, we get to my sister's house,
and we can't work anything.
18 remotes --
we couldn't turn on the TV.
It was like the whole house
was smarter than us.
I swear, at one point, I think I
heard the oven laughing at me.
[ Laughs ]
- You work at Orson Quarry?
- Yeah.
What's that like?
Oh, well, have you seen "The Flintstones"?
[ Laughs ]
It's pretty much like that.
Except at the end of the day,
we don't slide down
the tail of a dinosaur.
Oh, that's a bummer.
Yeah.
[ Chuckles ]
I hate to disappoint you.
[ Chuckles ]
Frankie:
Well, this is our stop.
- Oh.
- Oh.
- This was great, guys.
- Yeah, do it again.
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah.
- Great.
- Take care.
Bye!
Well, that was pathetic.
What do you mean?
I had fun.
Yeah, of course you did, Mike.
You weren't talking to me.
Hey, you were chattin' it up
pretty good with Dale yourself.
It was like a one-woman show
back there.
Tell me about it.
I was adorable -- witty, clever.
I have never felt so alive.
And you?
You're totally bringing it
for Vicki.
Eh.
Yeah, you were talkative,
you were smiling.
Don't you get it?
That walk proves
that we can be fun and charming.
But we shouldn't just bring it
for other people.
We should bring it
for each other.
Let's try it.
Let's be interesting
for each other.
Now?
No, I'm tired now,
but we'll hit it hard tomorrow.
I still don't get
what we're doing.
Trust me.
It's gonna be awesome.
You start with
the first book you ever read,
then go all the way
to the last book you've read.
It's your whole life's
journey in books.
Then we knock them down like
dominos, video it,
you show it in class --
"Boom!" -- they go nuts.
Guaranteed A.
But that doesn't have
anything to do with
"The Old Man And The Sea."
See? That's
your problem, Brick.
You are a rigid thinker.
That's why I'm gonna end up
ruling the world.
All the big-time rich guys --
Steve Jobs...
other guys --
they're all creative thinkers,
risk-takers.
I don't know about this, Axl.
Wha-- look, that's fine.
Go ahead.
Dress like one of
the characters in the book
and do a lame presentation
like a million other kids.
What do you want, Brick?
Do you want to go
the safe route,
or do you want to be
an innovator,
a trailblazer, a rule breaker?!
I do.
Then give me "One fish,
two fish, red fish, blue fish"
and let's change the world!
Yeah!
Surprise!
I'm here to take you to prom!
What?
Yeah, my mom
was talking to your mom,
and she was saying how no one
had asked you to prom yet
and how crazy that was.
So my mom said, "It might
be nice if you'd take her,"
and I said, "Are you kidding me?
I'd do anything for Susie Q!"
You're like family.
Oh! Wow, Sean.
That is so incredibly nice!
Actually,
the funny thing is --
Yeah, my car broke down twice
on the way down here
from Notre Dame,
but I got it fixed.
And I had to ask a professor
to move a big test,
and I'm missing
my fraternity photo,
but I said, "I don't care.
[ Chuckles ]
I'm takin' Sue to her prom."
So, here I am.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Ding! ]
Well, great!
- Yay!
- Yeah!
Fun!
Frankie: So, Sue had gone from no
dates to the prom to two dates --
a problem she never in her life
could have anticipated.
But since Sean had gone
to all that effort,
Sue knew she had to do
the right thing
and kick Edwin to the curb.
Okay, what color
are you wearing?
Uh, green and burnt tangerine.
No, silly, for the prom.
'Cause I want to get
a matching cummerbund.
Uh --
Oh, and I'm gonna wear
my dress shoes,
but can I put my jazz shoes
in your purse for dancing later?
Brad, what are you
talking about?
Prom. We always said that
if neither of us had a date,
we'd be each other's date.
I'm so glad I have you.
Otherwise, I'd be devastated.
So, we're going together,
right?
You bet!
[ Ding! ]
[ Both laugh ]
Hey, did I tell you we got
those new rotary saliva ejectors
at work?
Hm.
Still gettin' spit on
a lot, though.
[ Sighs ]
Got to get working
on those taxes.
Yep.
Comes faster every year.
It does.
Mike: They're not here,
Frankie.
[ Sighs ]
I'm so confused.
I mean,
Brad is an amazing friend
and he has always been there
for me, and he'll do my makeup.
But Sean drove all the way down
from Notre Dame
just to take me.
What do you think I should do?
Oh. Ha ha.
Very funny, Axl.
You know, this is
a very serious issue
and a lot of people's feelings
are at stake
and you are not being
very supportive!
Sue: Aah!
You. Me. Prom.
Pick me up at 7:00.
Show some leg.
Are you -- What --
No, no, no, but I-I--
[ Gasps ]
Ha.
[ Ding! ]
Yeah. Right.
[ Sighs ]
You know what?
Maybe we've just said
everything we've had to say
to each other.
You wanted to bring it,
I wanted to bring it.
Maybe there's
just nothing to bring.
This is why we should never
leave the couch.
Let the cable company bring it.
Yeah, that's fine for now.
But when the kids leave,
it's just gonna be you and me,
and we're not gonna have
anything to talk about.
Then we're just gonna be two old
people staring at each other.
We won't be alone.
Brick will be here,
jumbling up our meds.
I'm just saying,
if we want to have any prayer
of an interesting life,
we're gonna have to bring
other people into it.
[ Sighs ] You know
what we should do?
I know it's not
your favorite thing,
but I think we should have
a dinner party.
- [ Groans ]
- You know, we used to have
those Memorial Day barbecues
every year.
We put the keg on the porch.
Remember?
I mean, we used to be fun,
social people, Mike.
I've seen the pictures.
Hmm.
I am pretty bored
of talking to you.
Exactly, and I'm totally sick
of talking to you.
Sure. What the hell?
Let's do it.
I love books.
Do you remember
"Pat The Bunny"?
You could feel the bunny.
Oh.
Hey, Darrin.
Hey, Sue.
- No-no-no-no-no! Bup-bup-bup!
- No, wait!
No!!
Oops.
Sorry.
Hey, again.
Oh, hey.
So, this is where
the Heck laundry goes down, huh?
Yep, this is where
the magic happens.
I've seen the clean clothes,
but you never get to see
behind the scenes.
[ Laughs ] Very few
have had the privilege.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Clears throat ]
So, listen, I was thinking,
you know, sometimes
people don't always
have dates to the prom.
[ Chuckles ]
And I don't know
if you do or you don't,
but if you don't and you want to
go, I'm around,
so I could take you
if you want.
Are you kidding me right now?!
No, uh, but if you
don't want to --
No. No, no, no,
no, no.
I do, I do, I do.
I definitely, definitely do.
I just have to check
on a few things.
But, yes.
Yes, my answer is yes.
[ Ding! ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Sighs deeply ]
Hey! Sue!
Excited for next Saturday?
I was just getting ready
to pick up your corsage.
Hope you like gardenias.
Actually, Sean, about that...
I really appreciate
you asking me.
Like, you have no idea
how much that means to me.
And I think it would be
really fun to go together,
but somehow, I ended up
with four other dates to prom.
So, unfortunately,
I won't be able to go with you.
Oh. Wow.
But it's not like I had four
other dates when you asked me.
I had one.
But of all the people
that I'm not going with,
you are really my favorite.
Okay! Yeah, no problem.
That's cool.
I'll -- I'll just --
I guess I'll just head on back
up to school.
It's a six-hour drive,
so I won't get back in time
for the fraternity photo.
But, hey,
there's always next year.
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you so much
for understanding, Sean.
I am so, so sorry.
Hey! No problem.
[ Ding! ]
What?!
Sue, you can't do this!
You know I would never,
but it's Darrin.
You know how I feel
about Darrin.
Sue, you promised.
Love affairs
with thick-necked,
handsome blond men
will come and go,
but best friendships
are forever.
I know, and I wouldn't cancel
if it was anybody else.
Well, if your girlfriend
from Canada
would suddenly be able to go --
Arena or Ariel --
It's Arena.
It's definitely Arena.
That's a real name.
Well, if she
was suddenly able to go,
you know I would be okay
letting you go with her
because that is
what is so great
about our friendship --
we always want the best
for each other.
[ Groans ]
All right, fine.
- Go with Darrin.
- Yes!
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!
[ Ding! ]
Hey, lady, my brother
said he can't take you to prom.
He's in juvie.
What? Why?
What'd he do?
None of your damn business!
[ Ding! ]
Hey, Edwin.
So, listen,
about prom --
Oh, I know all about it.
You didn't think
I'd hear about you and Brad,
the great hot-dog
adventure guy?
Uh, what?
Yeah, it's all over
the food court.
He's counter, I'm management.
You had a good thing,
and you blew it.
You don't think I could've
taken Kathy at Orange Julius?
As soon as her lap-band kicks
in, she's gonna be gorgeous.
Oh, I was gonna tell you
what the featured potato is
for next month,
but now you'll just have to
find out with everyone else.
Ohh.
Yeah!
[ Ding! ]
Hey, I didn't know
you were in town.
Yeah, I was doing a favor
for my mom taking Sue to prom.
I was happy to do it,
but it turns out
she's got like four other dates.
Wait. Are you sure?
'Cause --
Yeah,
that's what she said --
four guys.
But I'm fine. It's --
it's fine. I'm fine.
I'll just smile through it just --
just like I smile through everything.
[ Cellphone rings ]
[ Beep ]
Hey, Sue, it's Darrin.
I wanted to talk to you
about prom.
When I asked you, I didn't
realize you had so many dates.
I was just trying to be nice,
but you can take me off
the list
because, clearly,
you've got a lot going on.
And the truth is, I didn't
really want to go anyway.
I mean,
I don't care about prom.
I've been before.
Like I said,
I was just being nice.
This is Darrin.
[ Ding! ]
[ Cries ]
[ Groans ]
[ Whimpers ]
So, who's the unlucky guy
you decided to go to prom with?
Actually, nobody.
I am taking myself to prom.
Just like Molly Ringwald
in "Pretty In Pink."
It's a very important movie from
the '80s about self-acceptance.
Wait, I thought
you were going with Darrin.
I was,
but then I guess he decided
he didn't want to go to prom
after all.
Oh, well.
I'm off to prom.
Will you take my picture?
[ Camera phone clicks ]
Thanks.
I know I'm only 12,
but that was the saddest thing
I've ever seen
in my entire life.
[ Sighs ]
Yeah.
Ooph. Bl-bl!
Dah, all right, agh!
[ Inhales sharply ]
We got to get this done before
mom's dumb dinner party.
- Mm.
- You ready?
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this!
[ Grunts ]
[ Exhales deeply ]
Okay.
[ Brick chuckles ]
Yes!
[ Laughs ]
Yes! Yes!
Ah! [ Laughs ]
Brilliant!
Oh, I'm a genius!
[ Laughs ]
Yes!
Yes! [ Laughs ]
Oh, my God!
Yes! Yes!
[ Laughs ]
Oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Oh, my God!
I'm a genius!
"He was an old man
who fished alone in a skiff."
You hooked?
Axl: And cut!
[ Cellphone beeps ]
Oh, yes, we did it!
Yes!
- Whoo!
- Oh, thank you!
Frankie: You know, I've never
been there. I hear it's nice.
Oh, no, I hate Santa Fe.
- What?
- Yeah, all that adobe.
You know, it's, like,
a whole city made of mud.
Oh, don't listen to him.
He doesn't hate Santa Fe.
How do you hate a whole city?
Well...
True story --
I suggested to Bill
that we vacation
in new Mexico once,
and he said no 'cause he didn't
want to leave the country.
[ Laughter ]
Hey, you -- you want a smart guy
or you a sexy guy?
'Cause, uh, I might be able
to introduce you to somebody.
[ Laughter ]
- Oh, Frankie, everything looks delicious!
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- Mangia! Mangia!
We went to Italy last summer,
and the only two things
he learned to say
were "Let's eat"
and "We can't afford that."
[ Laughter ]
We went to Italy
last summer, too!
Really?
- Yeah, we went on a cruise
for our anniversary. - We did.
Oh, yeah?
Where'd you guys go?
Oh, well, we went
to the whole Tuscany thing.
Oh, where?
[ Indistinct conversations ]
- What does?
- Like tongue-twisters.
And sometimes you can get into
these mud --
it's like a mud bath.
It's like a -- it's like mask
for your whole body.
So, what did you do today?
♪ hey, you ♪
♪ shine like a star,
'cause you know that you are ♪
Hey, Sue.
Are you here alone?
Yeah.
Me, too.
Yep, it wouldn't be prom
if some poor Heck
didn't end up going
with Weird Ashley.
Okay, I downloaded the video
onto the laptop.
Are you ready for greatness?!
- Lay it on me.
- All right!
Let's do this!
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, there it goes!
Oh, my God.
It's working!
Oh, my God!
I'm a genius!
[ Laughs ]
Brick, oh! You're so lucky
you got me for a brother!
Brick: "He was an old man who
fished alone in a skiff."
You hooked?
And cut!
[ Beep ]
Aah, grades don't really matter
till high school anyway.
[ Chuckles ]
What are you doing?
Nothing. Just
getting some coffee.
What are you doing in here?
I don't know. Came to see
what you were doing.
Hmm. Well, I suppose one of us
should be in there.
Why? We're just
talking to each other.
I think we've established
we don't have anything
to say to each other.
Besides, they won't
even know we're gone.
[ Laughter in distance ]
Well, should we go back there
and try to get in the mix?
Seems like a lot of work.
Let's just take our foot
off the pedal
- and coast to the grave.
- [ Sighs ]
Woman: - Impossible!
- Do you hear that?
Why did you say
that you hated Santa Fe?
How do you know those people
are not from Santa Fe?!
So what if they are?
Okay?
Why are you always so worried
about what people think?
You say something and you don't think
and then you embarrass everyone!
Oh, yeah, you're worried
about being embarrassed.
Do you realize how loud
your laugh is?
You can't even hear other people
'cause your laugh is so loud.
- Oh, great, so now you're gonna
tell me how to laugh? - Yeah.
I don't tell you
how to eat --
the way your teeth click
together when you chew!
Sometimes, all it takes
to feel better about yourselves
is seeing somebody
who's got it worse.
Maybe behind closed doors,
nobody's really bringing it.
And as a bonus, it gave us
plenty to talk about.
Can you believe he talked
to her like that?
- Ohh.
- I had no idea.
You look at their house,
and it's all perfect,
but you don't know.
You never know.
I mean, it makes sense 'cause
you know how controlling she is,
so of course she is with him.
And he's out of town
all the time.
- You got to wonder.
- You really do. [ Exhales deeply ]
Did you hear what she said
to him when they were leaving?
[ Gasps ]
Don't tell me yet. Save it.
We'll take a walk tomorrow.
You can tell me about it then.
[ Knock on door ] Hey, am I too
late for the big book tipping?
- Did I miss it?
- [ Sighs ]
Yeah, you missed it.
Whatever, Darrin.
Hey. What's with you?
What's with me?
I don't want to see
your stupid face right now.
That's what's with me.
That's not very nice to say that
about somebody's face.
What did my face
ever do to you?
You told my sister you were
gonna take her to prom,
and then, like, you just
cancel on her last minute?
What are you talking about?
She has like a million dates.
No, she doesn't, Darrin.
She went to prom alone,
and she wanted to go with you,
so nice goin'.
[ Clicks tongue ]
She doesn't even like me.
Oh, my God.
Are you an idiot?
Do you not see how she gets
those weird, googly eyes
whenever you come over
and grins like an idiot?
It's completely disgusting
and makes me want to vomit.
But for whatever reason,
she still really likes you,
and you really hurt her,
and that's not cool.
You do not hurt my sister.
I had no idea.
Deejay:
And here's another slow song,
so hold on tight
to the one you love.
[ Bora York's
"Dreaming Free" plays ]
You know what, Ashley?
Uh, I'm kind of tired,
and I'm really not
having that much fun.
It's not you.
It's me.
I think
I'm just gonna head home.

But I --

I don't.
I only care about you.
[ The Chevin's
"Beautiful World" plays ]
I know it didn't work out
last time
and you told me to forget you,
but the thing is, Sue, I can't.
I think about you all the time.
And I get up, and I think,
"Okay, I will not
think about Sue today."
But then it backfires, 'cause I'm
thinking about you even more, and...
