[ Crow caws ]
Frankie:
Out here in the Middle,
people are pretty self-reliant.
We mow our own lawns.
We paint our own houses.
We wash our own cars.
And if you can't do it alone,
you ask your family to help.
Chop-chop, people.
Fold while you eat.
Axl, we're in the middle
of dinner.
Yeah, exactly, and I got to
get back up to school
before the cafeteria closes,
'cause there's no way I'm eating
this slop you're eating.
Look, if you don't like
expiration-date-soup night,
fine, but I took the time
to dump all those cans
into the pot,
so the least you could do
is show a little appreciation.
Think maybe we could
cut a corner somewhere else,
besides food?
Yeah, Mike, we don't have
any corners left.
We're living in a circle here.
Hearing a lot of talking,
not seeing a lot of folding.
Hey, I got your socks.
- Oh.
- Sue.
Oh, I'm trying out
for volleyball
so I got to practice
every chance I get.
Mm!
Okay, no volleyball
at the table, please.
Really? It's a good distraction
from the food.
Mike: Sue, are you sure
about this volleyball thing?
Those girls have probably
been playing a long time.
[ Scoffs ] Sure, I'm sure.
Why shouldn't I try out?
I mean, I've never
not made volleyball.
She does have a point.
Oh, my God!
What did you do to your hands?
Ha! Blue nail polish!
Dad, did you see this?
Did you see what your wife
did to her nails?
[ Laughing ]
Look, check it out!
That's hi-larious!
Wow, mom. [ Laughing ] Just wow.
[ Chuckles ] What do you got
going on there, Frankie?
Frankie: It's nothing!
Geez, I don't know.
It's just a little fun thing.
I heard bright colors
were in this season.
Yeah, but why nails?
I mean, if you're gonna
do something,
do something about
those sandpaper elbows.
Yeah, I brushed up
against them yesterday,
and they almost cut me.
- [ Laughs ]
- No, you guys, this is good.
This is what you are supposed
to do when you're older.
You're supposed to do something
that draws attention
away from your face.
They do match the color
of the veins in her neck.
Is that what
you were going for, mom?
Yeah, Brick, that's what I
wanted-- to find a nail color
that matches
the bulging veins in my neck.
[ Crunches ]
Come on.
Why you taking it off?
I'm taking it off
so I won't be offending anyone
by doing something
light and fun.
Don't be so sensitive, Frankie.
They were teasing you.
They tease me, too.
Remember the time
I missed a belt loop?
Really, Mike? That's it?
That's the best you got?
You may not realize it,
but I get teased around here
all the time--
way more than you.
[ Laughing ]
Mom, that's hilarious!
You don't have to type "www"
before you put in
a website anymore.
Guys! Hey, guys,
guess what mom just did!
Yeah, no...
[ Laughs ]
She's so old!
[ Sneezes ]
Oh, you know, I think
I'm "allerngic" to this blanket.
[ Chuckles ]
Did you hear that, dad?
Mom's "allerngic"!
[ Chuckles ]
Okay, ha, ha.
I mispronounced one little word.
Give me a break.
[ Volume increases ]
Hey, why are you raising the "vulume"?
[ Giggles ]
Oh, come on, mom.
Don't walk away "mud."
You're favorite
"proogrom's" on!
Aw, come back!
"Frunkie"!
[ Laughs ]
Hey, everyone
gets teased around here.
That's how we show affection.
Affection? Really?
I always
thought of affection as,
you know--
I don't know-- a hug?
Which actually might be nice
once in a while.
All right.
I'll remember that.
Dr. Patel:
That concludes the first part
of the Prime Number Theorem.
Let's pick this up on Monday,
shall we?
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Axl Heck, may I speak to you?
Yeah.
Hey, Axl.
Can you hang back for a sec?
Mm-hmm.
Señor Heck, a minute?
Axl, based on
your lackluster performance
on my quizzes and tests,
you must know that it is
mathematically impossible
for you to pass this class.
Unless I buckle down.
Dude, there's no more
"buckling down."
You didn't hand in
any of your papers,
and if you don't
drop this class,
I'm gonna have to fail you.
Unless... I hit it hard
and turn it around?
The time to
turn it around has passed.
The only way to avoid
a failing grade is to...
- Drop this class.
- Drop this class.
Dejar esa clase.
What?
I'm sorry.
[ Chuckles ]
I've been really lost
all quarter.
I have no clue
what you're saying.
Drop this class.
Comprende?
Oui.
[ Telephone ringing ]
Mike, can you grab that?
My nails are wet.
Hmm.
Can't think of anyone
I'd want to talk to.
It's the high school.
Yeah.
That's never good.
[ Beep ]
Tink: Hey, there!
Coach Tink Babbitt
here from Orson High.
Just letting you know we'd love
to have your talented daughter
on the volleyball team
this season!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
[ Beep ]
Hello!
O-oh, hi!
Hi! Hi.
S-so, you're saying
she made it?
She sure did!
She really nailed her tryout.
Axl, is this you?
Uh, excuse me?
Hold on. Y-you are talking
about Sue Heck, right?
Long, straight brown hair,
braces.
That's the one!
And we'd love to offer her
a spot on the varsity team!
Okay,
j-just to be super-clear,
you're positive
you're looking at the list
of the girls who made it?
We wouldn't normally ask,
but these are things
that have happened.
Yep, 100% talking
about your daughter.
[ Chuckles ] So, Sue will need
a pair of shorts, kneepads,
and do you guys have a lawyer?
Uh... we're kind of
in between lawyers right now.
Great. Ooh, and we sent her home
with some forms.
If you could just
sign these real quick
and get 'em back to us,
that'd be great.
And congratulations!
[ Chuckles ]
Go Hens!
Go Hens!
[ Click ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Beep ]
Wow!
Sue made volleyball.
Now, when she gets home,
act surprised.
Oh, I don't have to act.
Whoo! [ Screaming ]
I made it! I made the team!
Varsity volleyball!
Oh, yeah!
[ Screaming ]
- [ Laughing ]
- Yay!
- Yay!
- Yay, congrats!
Oh, the tryouts
were ahh-ahh-ahh-mazing!
You guys won't believe
what happened.
Ready?
Good. Go, go!
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Okay.
Heck!
- Yeah.
- We'll give you a bump, set,
then you come in
from the outside and hit.
- Got it?
- Got it!
[ Whistle blows ]
[ Crashing ]
[ All gasping ]
I'm okay!
And thank God the janitor
break room's down there
because that old couch
really broke my fall.
Anyway, they must have been
super impressed
with how well I bounced back
because now
they want me on the team!
[ Gasps ] Oh, and they said
it was very important
that you sign and date
all these release forms,
waiving your right to any legal
recourse or something like that.
But coach said
once I bring these papers back
I'll be all set.
Get it?
[ Chuckles ]
All set.
It's a volleyball word.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh.
[ Both chuckle ]
[ Laughs ] Whoo-hoo!
Hey, buddy.
What's up?
- [ Sue grunting ]
- I'm not gonna fold your underpants.
Is that why you think I'm here?
[ Scoffs, chuckles ]
Nah.
It's just I've been
feeling guilty 'cause I kept
promising you could
come up to college with me
and I feel bad
it hasn't happened.
But I really think
now's the time.
Really? Can we visit the library
and check out the microfiche?
Microfiche.
Yeah, sure.
Um, I don't know
if the cafeteria
is serving that, but, uh...
Sue, what the hell
are you doing?
I'm practicing my jumps
for the volleyball team.
I am increasing my vertical,
as they say.
I have hit
"Hello, high flyer" twice.
But I'm still shooting
for "You're my she-ro."
Well, you got those
big boat feet. Use them.
- [ Grunts ]
- No, no, no, no, no.
You're not
using your arms right.
Here. Watch and learn
from the master.
- Oh.
- Hey.
All right.
It's very easy.
It's not that high.
Hey, mom. Hey, dad.
W-we're seeing
who can jump higher.
I made
the jumping meter myself.
- Oh.
- [ Grunts ] Yeah!
Oh, that's clever.
Dad, try.
[ Tap ]
I win.
Well, that's not fair.
You're 17 feet tall.
Of course you're
the queen of all awesome.
- [ Chuckles ]
- I can do that.
I already did it.
Look.
Oh, okay.
Who's the
queen of all awesome now?
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah.
What do you got, Brick?
- Oh.
Frankie: - Okay. Brick!
All chanting: Brick, Brick...!
- Ho!
- Oh!
- Good effort.
- All right, yeah.
Thanks.
I felt I did well.
All right.
I guess I'm up.
- Mom.
- Mm-hmm.
- Frankie.
- Do it for the ladies. Whoo!
Axl: - You got this.
- [ Crack ]
Ooh! Aah! Aah!
Oh, no, that's not good.
What?
- What was that?
- Was that a jump? - Did you see that?
I see it.
I don't think I can unsee it.
- Wait, wait, wait, mom.
- You got to do it again
'cause I-I didn't
have my phone out.
- Do it again. Do it again. Do it again.
- Sue: No, stop.
It's just nature's way
of protecting mom's bones.
- Do it again!
- Frankie, what do you have going on there?
I don't know. I just...
I couldn't get up.
Maybe it's-- maybe it's 'cause
I'm wearing my work shoes.
Tennis shoes, yeah.
The rubber soles
made you stick to the ground.
- [ Laughter ]
- Hey, hey, did you guys think
that she might be
"allerngic" to jumping?
Oh, oh. Are we gonna
bring that up again?
- Okay.
- [ Laughter ]
I never thought
I'd see anything funnier
- than when she tried to play football.
- Stop. My ribs hurt.
- Oh, God! She was like this.
- It wasn't that funny.
- It was like this.
- [ Laughs ] Yeah, it was.
Axl, we drove
through campus so fast
I didn't get to see
any of the fun stuff on my list.
Hmm.
The Life Science plant
and soil laboratory,
the Scandinavian
cultural center,
the Florence Henderson library.
Not to worry,
there's plenty to read... here.
[ Chuckles ]
Hey!
So, just now, I thought of
this really funny game.
Uh, pretend I'm an alien
and I don't know anything
about math
and you've got to make
me understand it
in, like, uh, hmm, one day.
[ Chuckles ]
Blip, bloop, blop,
blop, bloop, dur.
[ Chuckles ]
Go!
I thought you wanted to
"hang" with your "little bro."
Did you really just bring me here
to help you study?
[ Sighs ] Why do I even ask anymore?
[ Sighs ] Okay.
Here's the thing, Brick.
I screwed up.
I screwed up big time.
And it's really, really bad.
I mean, I thought
I was doing okay,
but three of my professors
told me I had to
drop their classes.
And if I drop three classes,
I'll only have one left
and that's Music Appreciation
which everyone calls
"Clap for credits,"
and I'm barely passing that.
That doesn't make any sense.
Clapping is something
you're actually good at.
I blame mom and dad.
'Cause I don't know
if you know this,
but I am completely
unsupervised here.
No one tells me to go to class.
No one
tells me to do my homework.
No one warns me that wearing
your shower shoes in the snow
is not a good idea.
Last week,
I slept for two whole days.
Nobody woke me up.
I brush my hair with a fork!
I always thought if mom and dad
would just get off my back,
I'd be fine.
But I need them, Brick.
I need them on my back.
[ Panting ]
Don't tell them I said that.
Can I tell them
we saw a girl in her bra?
Tell them nothing!
I'm scared, Brick.
I'm really, really scared.
All my teachers told me
it was impossible
for me to pass
at this point, but...
if you help me
study this weekend,
I know I can
bring my grades up.
And I get this is all
probably weird.
'Cause usually I'm a billion
times more awesome than you,
but right now...
I really, really,
really need your help.
[ Sighs ] Okay.
I'm gonna need
a highlighter pen,
Goldfish Crackers,
and a 44-ounce Slushie-- blue.
Oh, and clear your schedule.
It's gonna be a long night.
♪
So, ever since
the jumping incident,
I found myself
just driving around in my car
after all my errands were done.
It was the one place
where no one
could criticize me.
[ Horn honks ]
Man: Nice driving, moron!
Move!
All right, all right.
[ Horn blares ]
Hey, hey, hey! Careful!
[ Tires screech ]
You're gonna get hurt.
♪ All over the place ♪
♪ I don't know... ♪
Hey, you. Hi.
[ Horn honking ]
Where's the fire, jerk face?
[ Sighs ] Sorry.
I don't usually talk like that,
but he pushed me.
You saw, right?
♪ It gets heavy ♪
Mike, you are not gonna believe
what just happened.
Well, I'm gonna guess
it has something to do
with that dog.
Well, yeah. I saved his life.
I rescued him.
He was just wandering around
on Bailey Street
and he could have gotten
hit by a car.
So, I opened my door
and he jumped right in.
Didn't you?
Didn't you just jump right in?
And check this out.
He follows me around.
[ Laughs ]
You love to follow me around.
Don't you love it, Colin Firth?
I named him Colin Firth.
You named him?
You don't think
we're keeping this dog, do you?
No, of course not.
I mean, obviously we need
to find out who owns him.
I'll put out some fliers
and stuff.
But he just looked
so sad and hungry.
Are you hungry, Colin Firth?
Are you?
I know you'll like
the cans of food I open.
Hmm.
You know, I finally got what
people like so much about dogs.
He was there
when I left for work,
he was there when I got home.
[ Colin Firth pants ]
And he looked at me
like I was the only person
in the whole world.
But unfortunately, he wasn't
so nice to everyone else.
[ Barking ]
- [ Growling ]
- Hey. You like volleyball?
[ Snarling ]
[ Fabric tears, air hisses ]
That's it. We are never
climbing Mount Everest.
Rich people sure like to die
in weird places.
Night, Frankie.
[ Sighs ]
- See you in the--
- [ Snarls ]
So, how are
those fliers coming?
[ Snarling ]
Ah.
Ha! Dad, dad.
Want to come watch
my volleyball game?
The team is doing
pretty awesome this season.
I don't know.
You think
you might actually play?
No.
But sometimes when the ball
goes off the court, I go get it.
Well, I'm watching you now,
so we're good.
But I made up a new cheer
to say from the sidelines.
We're gonna bump, set,
and spike it,
'cause that's the way
we like it!
Yeah. That's good.
Not get-in-the-car
good.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Announcer:
Another point for the Hens.
Go team. Go Hens.
The score now is Hens 24,
Warriors 23.
[ Whistle blows ]
Time-out, Warriors.
You see that guy over there?
That's Floorboard's dad.
Sue! Sue! Sue!
Oh, my God.
Did you hear that?
I don't think
he's being very subtle
about what he's gonna do.
Sue!
Who's that guy next to him?
Oh, no. Looks like
he's lawyered up already.
We got to put her in.
What?
It's match point!
We can't afford
another lawsuit.
Not after Monica Ruiz
and the Bunsen-burner incident.
She's still wearing a hat.
Floorboard!
You're in! Let's go!
Seriously?
I'm-- I'm in?
As in, in the court?
Like, where they are?
Hustle!
You! Come on!
Move, move, move, move!
Out!
And substitution now in--
number 10, Sue Heck.
Man: Come on, Hens. Let's go.
Woman: Come on, Hens.
[ Whistle blows ]
[ Cheering ]
Mine. Mine!
And then it happened.
It was match point
and the ball was coming
straight for Sue.
♪
And the Hens win!
Yes!
[ Cheering ]
All: [ Chanting ] Floorboard!
Floorboard! Floorboard!
Floorboard! Floorboard!
Floorboard! Floorboard!
Floorboard! Floorboard!
Floorboard! Floorboard!
Floorboard! Floorboard! Floorboard!
Floorboard! Floorboard!
Floorboard! Floorboard!
Floorboard!
- Floorboard!
- Yeah!
All right, now I'm gonna need
your Math syllabus,
your quizzes,
and all your homework.
Okay. Syllabus.
Syllabus. Uh...
Syllabus.
Oh! Is this is it?
It also makes
a great back-scratcher.
Axl, that's a protractor.
What I need is your syllabus.
You know, that piece of paper
they give you
at the beginning of the year
and it tells you what's
gonna be covered in class?
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I don't have that.
[ Sighs ]
Then just give me
all the Math homework you did.
Gotcha.
Let me just have
a quick look around.
Um, hmm, okay.
Uh, wait. Hold on.
It's got to be
around here some-- Oh!
Here it is.
Ah, my Math homework
was in my Philosophy folder,
which I may have turned
into a paper airplane.
Axl, this is completely
illegible.
Thank you, 'cause my teacher
said he couldn't even read it.
Oh! Here we go.
Here's my notes
I took in Philosophy class.
[ Sniffs ]
Oh, they, uh, sort of reek.
Do I smell like that?
[ Sniffs ]
Why are there stars
all over this?
Oh, I use that to mark down
where all the hot chicks
were sitting.
So, you did nothing?
Uh, I got Sarah's phone number.
[ Scoffs ]
I mean, look at
where she was sitting
compared to
where I was sitting.
That was not easy.
You should really learn
from my mistakes, Brick.
That's a lot to learn.
Don't worry.
I know what we need to do.
[ Groans ]
Why is this so hard?
It's way too much work
and I don't understand
how to do any of it.
Honestly,
it's not that complex.
I promise
you'll get the hang of it.
See, this goes here,
and you're gonna want to
put this information
right up there...
and that is how you drop
Fundamentals Of Math.
Oh!
I see. Okay.
Hey, let me try
and drop Philosophy on my own.
But don't go anywhere,
'cause I might need you.
All right. Uh-huh.
I did it! [ Chuckles ] Yes!
I am kicking college's ass!
[ Barking ]
Whoa! Whoa!
What is this thing?
It's a monster!
Get it away from me!
Oh, that's mom's crazy dog.
Personally, not a fan.
Okay. That's it.
Frankie, you know what?
We're getting rid of the dog.
[ Growls ]
What? No, no, no. I told you.
I'm gonna put up fliers.
You're not gonna put up fliers.
E-everyone knows
you're not gonna do that.
I will.
I-I-I just got to find
some blank paper.
Do you know how hard it is
to find plain white paper
in this house?
We already got an evil rabbit.
We don't need another
crazy animal around here.
- He's kind of mean. - He's psycho.
- He doesn't really add anything.
I'm sure we'll find someone
who will take him.
No, we are not getting rid
of the only thing in this house
that loves me.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the fact
that Colin Firth
actually appreciates me.
He listens
to what I have to say.
When is the last time
any of you listened to me, huh?
It's just "Mom, we need this,"
"Mom we need that."
"Dad, there's no toilet paper,"
said no one ever.
All you see when you look at me
is something to make fun of.
"Ha, ha, ha, mom was born
in the pioneer days,"
"Mom can't jump,"
"Oh, mom's wearing
her sweatpants backwards."
Okay. I'm sorry.
I thought the word "Juicy"
was supposed to go
on the front, okay?
And I just laugh along
like it's all okay,
and it piles up.
And it's just chip, chip, chip,
and pick, pick, pick,
and it takes its toll, people.
It takes its toll!
Do you want to know
why I can't jump?
I'll tell you why.
'Cause I have the weight
of all your ridicule and disdain
piled on my back
and dragging me down!
That's why I can't jump!
So, when you are all
laughing and snickering...
[ Voice breaking ]
you remember I am not just some
mom punching bag!
I am a person
with feelings, okay?
[ Barks ]
Brick:
I would prefer to not go in?
Mike: Guys, come on.
Sue: Brick's the cutest.
Let's send him.
Axl: But you're the husband.
Man up and go.
- Just open the door.
- She seems extra mad.
Brick: You go first.
Axl: I don't even
live here anymore.
[ Door creaks ]
So, uh, listen.
The kids and I were talking.
And, uh, we felt like
there's something
that we wanted to say to you.
Mom, I am so, so sorry.
You mean everything to me,
and I never meant
to hurt your feelings.
You know, a lot of moms
probably can't jump,
and you do lots of stuff
better than jump...
a-and I will get you those
examples at a later date.
I think the thing
to remember here
is sometimes people mess up,
and maybe they don't tell you
they messed up right away,
'cause it might not be
the right time,
but the important thing is,
when they do
eventually tell you,
it's good to remember
that everyone's
just finding their way
and making mistakes as they go.
What? Axl, what does that
have to do with--
I'm just saying
if you have love in your heart,
forgiveness is a big part
of that.
Hey, look at this.
College has been good
for this kid.
[ Chuckles ]
That's the thing about family.
Sometimes they tear you down,
but they can also lift you up.
Whoo!
Queen of all awesome!
Sue: Whoo!
- Go, mom!
- [ Barking ]
Aah!
[ Indistinct conversation ]
