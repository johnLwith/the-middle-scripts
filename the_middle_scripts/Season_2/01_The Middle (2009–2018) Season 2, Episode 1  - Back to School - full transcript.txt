Ah, summer vacation... ...
Weekends at the lake,
driving cross-country
in a winnebago, Disneyland.
Yeah, well,
all that costs money.
This is how our summer went.
I'm bored.
I'm bored.
We're bored.
Kids, it's summer.
Get up off the couch
and go outside and play.
Yeah. Nice.
Okay. Everybody get inside
and watch tv.
But finally you hit...
the most glorious day
of summer... the last one,
when the kids
go back to school...
and you finally get some
order back in your life.
We cannot be late
for the first day of school!
Let's go! Let's go!
Where is axl?
Brick, go get your brother up.
Axl! Get up!
Did you brush your teeth? Sorry.
I guess I'm out of the habit from summer.
Here. Rinse and spit.
Where are my school supplies?
Mike, where are the school supplies?
I don't know.
You said you were gonna steal some from work.
I've taken too much! Ehlert is on to me.
This is just not a good way
to start my first year...
on cross-country. We got a bowling pencil...
And a paper clip.
That's all youeed for the first day. Oh, brick!
You left a sandwich in here from last year.
That's disgusting!
And you got an "a"
on your "I love winter" paper.
Good job! Ohh. God, when
did I even make egg salad?
Oh! It's not egg salad. Ew, ew, ew.
Mom, you have to sign these forms.
What forms? You were supposed to
sign them and give me a check today,
or I won't get
my cross-country sweatshirt.
If I don't have
my cross-country sweatshirt,
no one will know I'm on cross-country.
You really want people to know you're on a loser sport...
like cross-country? It sucks.
Oh, shut up, axl!
Dad, did you just hear what axl sneezed about
cross-country? We don't say "shut up."
Mom said "shut up" yesterday.
We don't tattle either.
Good enough.
There's the bus. Strap it on and go.
It's still wet. There's school today?
When was I supposed to find out about this?
Nice parenting, mom.
Okay, that's it. Everybody
on the bus. Here we go.
Hurry up! Everybody out! Let's go, let's go.
Here we go. Here we go. Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Have a great day. We'll miss you.
Stay late if you have to.
We missed the bus.
How many days
until summer?
Well, the school year was off
to an awesome start.
The kids were late for class,
and I was late for work.
Luckily, I had Bob to cover for me.
Bob! Where the hell is frances?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Oh, Frankie!
Sorry. I let you down.
Punish me, Mr. ehlert.
Whatever you're gonna do to her,
do to me. Unless you were
making her work the weekend...
of the persimmon festival. I'm Manning a booth.
You've never manned anything.
I'm so sorry, Mr. ehlert.
It's just, today is
the kids' first day of school,
and we're not exactly back to our routine yet,
and... Pete, what are your kids doing right now?
I have no idea, sir.
You see? Now that's a salesman.
We should be ashamed
of ourselves, Mike. Ashamed.
You know, every year we say
we're gonna get better,
and we never are.
There's no reason that
we can't be those other people.
What other people? The good people.
The ones who aren't late for work.
The ones who don't send
their son to school...
with a nail scissors
and a lip pencil...
and call it
"school supplies."
No. You know what?
It's a new day.
We're making a change.
Starting now, we are gettin'
out in front of it.
You get innt of it.
I'll get under it.
Night, honey.
I am sensing that
you're not nearly as ashamed...
as you should be.
Mnh-mnh.
No. I'm serious.
If this was "supernanny"...
and we saw this morning
on hidden home camera,
jo would crucify us.
I swear to God, I will pull
that cable out of the wall.
Okay. Fine.
You stay the same,
and I will grow
into a better person alone.
You sleep.
I will fill out...
three children's worth
of school forms by myself.
Fine.
You want help filling out
the forms,
I will help you fill out
the forms.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
What's the pediatrician's name
again?
Doctor...
Larimer.
Larimer. Sure.
And sue's middle name
would be...
You know her middle name.
Sue. Remember?
Oh. They wrote it down twice
on her birth certificate...
by accident,
and we keep saying we're gonna go
down there and change it...
And we never do. They want
three "in case of emergency" people?
Yep.
Seems excessive.
We'll give 'em one.
This was your plan
all along, wasn't it?
Maybe. Night, honey.
Mm.
Okay.
You just get your sleep,
'cause tomorrow's
a new leaf, baby. New leaf.
Sue sue heck.
Yeah, we really probably
should've made the time...
to change that.
I smell cooking.
Is grandma here?
No, grandma's not here.
I'm making us a good breakfast...
so we can start our day off right. Yep.
We're gettin' out in front of it.
That's what we're doing,
honey, right? Yeah.
I smell bacon. Grandma?
Other people can cook food
besides grandma, you know.
Aah! There's a weird
noise coming out of my clock!
Make it stop! Axl, relax.
I set your alarm last night,
so you would have time to get up
and get ready for school...
without being rushed.
Grandma?
Grandma is not here. I'm here.
Now I want you all
to sit down and listen up.
We're getting up on time. We're
having a healthy breakfast.
We'll start the day organized
and armed for success.
Don't do it. Clearly
these are not our parents.
If you can make that case,
I'm on board.
Sit.
So... in order not to have
a repeat of yesterday,
I have borrowed this chart
from work.
Now for the purposes
of this exercise,
brick, you'll be Mr. ehlert.
Axl, you be Pete.
Sus Lou, I'm me,
and, Mike, you can be Bob.
Do I have to bbob?
Yes. Okay. Lou, today you have
cross-country practice,
so I have for you
your signed forms...
and a check for your
new cross-country sweatshirt.
Pete, you have the food drive.
Here's your canned corn.
Please put it in the bin
and don't use it for fake vomit.
Now, most exciting
of all, brick...
I mean, Mr. ehlert...
I have for you
a brand-new backpack.
But I don't want
a new backpack.
I love my old backpack.
I know that you loved
your old backpack,
but that thing practically
walked to the garbage itself.
But it was my friend! Who am I
supposed to eat lunch with?
I don't know. A person?
Okay, so my family was
a little slow to make change.
I was getting ahead of it.
I was baking brownies,
and by the end of the day...
i was already seeing results.
Whoo-hoo!
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Oh!
You look great!
And so athletic!
And I'm the only one
who has one,
because my awesome mom
sent in a check.
Other moms just don't get it.
I feel sorry for their kids.
Well, thank you
for the worst day ever.
Now that you've screwed up
my body clock,
I had to drag myself
through gym,
and then I dozed off
and sleep-farted in science.
Ooh, brownies. Those aren't for now.
Those are for all the bake sales...
I'm gonna be hit up for this year. When are you
gonna give up on this sicko experiment of yours?
This isn't like the juicer!
We're following through!
Well, the new backpack and I
are not getting along...
At all.
What happened?
Why was your backpack
even on your head?
I was seeing if it had
the same echo as my old one.
It doesn't.
We have to go talk to brick's teacher.
Oh, no.
When did we get the call?
We didn't yet, but he was
already weird today,
and it's just a matter of time,
so I say, let's get ahead of it...
and ll the meeting
before the teacher calls us.
Why? Why do we gotta go
lookin' for trouble?
I'm pretty sure
it knows our address.
Listen, I know
what I'm doing here, Mike.
I got a freezer
full of brownies,
and sue called me "awesome."
There's brownies?
Trust me.
If we make the call,
then we're in control,
and we're the ones
callin' the shots.
And that's why we
thought we could offer some insights...
into our son that might make
the year go more smoothly.
So you're here
on the third day of school...
to try to get your child
some special attention.
Well, no,
not special attention.
But, you see, he is...
You know,
a little special.
Let me tell you something,
mommy.
Every parent thinks
their child is special.
They can't all be.
Th's impossible.
I mean, some children
are just average.
We know.
That's our other two kids.
Yeah, but, see,
brick is quirky-special.
Special needs?
No, not that special.
Well, then he's normal.
So what are you doing here,
dear... on my lunch hour?
Well, uh, we were just trying...
to get out on top of it,
and, um,
you see, brick whispers.
There is such a thing
as overparenting, mommy.
That's not us. No.
If anything, we underparent.
We phone it in.
Right, daddy?
(Chuckle I don't know
what we're doing here.
(Chuckle I don't know
what we're doing here.
Are we trying to convince her...
thatrick is weird or not weird or what?
I know that it's easy for some mothers...
to latch on to their sons
too tightly.
Maybe you're trying to get
from him what is missing...
in your relationship
with your husband. Hey.
Let me tell you something.
You add an "s" to "mother," you
know what you get? "Smother."
And no child benefits...
by being raised by a smother.
I am not!
I'm not a smother.
I'm a lazy parent
with a weird kid. Go on.
Tell her, Mike. Just tell her
how pathetic we are.
All right. Okay. I'm pullin'
the rip cord on this thing.
Grab your purse. Let's go.
Okay, so the meeting
with brick's teaer...
was a little rough,
but it wasn't about me.
It was about helping brick.
Brick? Brick heck, right?
Uh-huh.
I'm moving you up close...
where I can keep an eye on you.
They want you to have
special attention.
I'll give you special attention.
Hey. You're already up.
Right. Up since 5:00.
Hope you're happy.
I'm a morning person now!
It was one day, axl.
I got you up on time one day.
Well, it's very dangerous...
to play around with
a teenager's sleep cycle.
Probably messed up
my development.
I probably won't be able to have
babies now or something, uh...
That might not be
such a bad thing.
Good morning. Oh, my God.
You're wearing that again?
It's supposed to be 80 degrees
all week. How do I know that?
'Cause there's nothing else on
at 5:00 A.M.
Except the hoosier farm report.
For your information,
axl, I have...
the fall athletic pep rally
tomorrow,
which I'm a part of...
And am promoting today.
Speaking of which,
I made buttons for all of you.
Wow! "Proud parent
of a cross-country star."
That's a lot of glitter.
I'll put mine on in the car.
...
Hey, where's brick?
Great. I finally get one kid up,
and now the other one's sleeping in.
And one for you.
Sue, go get your brother up.
Brick, get up!
What are you,
your brother now?
Why aren't you ready
for school?
I'm taking a personal day.
Personal day.
Come on.
You love school. Get up.
Please don't make me go.
I don't like my new teacher.
Why not?
Everything was going great,
but then all of a sudden,
she drags my desk
to the front of the class.
I like sitting in the back.
I read my book,
and I sip my juice box.
I'm back by the sharpener.
It's all good.
Maybe Mrs. rinsky's taken
a special interest in you.
Doesn't that make you feel
well-cared-for...
and understood...
and, you know...
Loved?
No. I feel like she's
watching me all the time,
and she won't let me
whisper to myself.
Whisper to myself.
I hate school.
I swear,
this is so not me.
I mean, for you to see me
at school twice in one week...
I'm usually here twice
the whole year, if that.
Look, I got the gals waiting
for me at beefsteak Charlie's,
so why don't we just cut to the chase?
If you could please just forget...
everything I said at our last meeting...
Done.
And go back to treating him
the way you would've treated him...
had I not come in,
and maybe move his desk back?
I know that would make brick
so happy.
So now the kid's
calling the shots?
No. I'm completely
calling the shots.
And you... well, you're
the main shot-caller.
Let me tell you somethin'.
You take the "m" off of "mom"...
and you replace it
with "g-l,"...
you know what you got?
I'll tell you
what you got. Glom.
Want me to conjugate it for u?
To glom.
She gloms.
She's a glommy mommy.
I am not a glommy mommy!
It's just that...
brick has never not wanted
to go to school before,
and I will not let you step
one foot out of this room...
until you promise to pay
no attention...
to anything I've said!
Fine.
But... I don't want
to see you anymore.
You don't volunteer
for the field trip.
You don't show up
for the science fair.
The annual mother's day
pancake breakfast...
Maybe you're not so hungry
that day.
Got it?
Damn. I really liked
that panke breakfast.
Hey. Oh, do you know
where the corncob holders are?
What the hell are you
doing? It's 2:00 in the morning.
Yeah, well, tell that
to my stomach,
'cause all it knows is
it's awake and it's hungry.
You guys are all like, "wake up
early. We'll be better people."
And my alarm is all,
"aah! Aah! Aah!"...
And mom is all,
"mnh! Mnh! Mnh!"...
Why do we have to listen
to what she says anyway?
You know, why don't you
just man up and say no?
You know nothing
about being a man.
Being a man is being smart.
I know that in may I want
to go to the indy 500.
It is expensive.
She won't want me to go.
But she will remember
that I supported her plan,
and if she does not,
I will remind her.
I will be going to the indy 500...
with no push-back.
And that, my son,
is being a man.
Hmm?
Mr. rasmussen?
Is it a problem that I have
to leave sixth period early...
'cause I'm a part of
thfall athletic pep rally?
Since this is first period, no.
Okay. Just checking.
Do you want to take off
your sweatshirt?
You look a little flushed.
Oh,
my cross-country sweatshirt?
No. I'm fine.
I need to wear it to
the fall athletic pep rally,
which I'm a part of.
Okay. So on page 24...
Mr. rasmussen,
do you need me to give you
my cross-country schedule,
so you can schedule tests
around my cross-country meets?
No.
Oh. Okay.
Whew.
Hey, brick. How was school?
Okay.
Did Ms. rinsky happen
to move your desk back?
Are you worried about me?
Well, I'm a mom. All moms
worry about their kids.
Ms. rinsky said,
my "mommy" came to see her,
and you were wored about me.
Okay. We had a deal. She was not
supposed to say anything to you.
Oh, my gosh.F you're worried,
maybe I should be worried.
No! Brick...
Should I be worried? Is there
something wrong with me?
Ow. Ow. Ow.
I guess this year just
seems harder than usual.
You know, the new backpack
and everything.
My old backpack always had
my back.
It's hard to go through it
all alone.
Aah! I ruined brick!
I took my happiest kid
and made him miserable.
I had to get that backpack
back.
Ugh!
Axl! Where's the trash?
I need brick's old backpack.
I took all the bags out to the curb.
What? You never take out the trash.
Why would you start now? Well, 'cause dad
told me to be smart and do what you say,
and I'm Bob, and Bob's supposed
to take out the trash,
so that's what I did.
You're not Bob, axl. You're Pete.
Go I'm three different people,
and none of them make you happy!
Oh, no.
Wait! Wait!
Hold on, please!
You gotta stop!
My son's best friend is
in there!
Wait!
Wait! Wait!
Just give me a minute!
I'll... I'll find it.
I'll find it!
Oh, my God. There's a lot
of shampoo left in this.
Victory!
Oh! Mwah! Yes!
Ta-da!
Nah. I think I'll keep
the new one. Thanks, though.
You just said that you msed it.
You said
it was throwing you off.
I can't tell if it's you
or the backpack,
but something smells
pretty rank.
Besides, the other kids
in my class seem to like...
this
sha-qwill O'Neal character.
Maybe it'll help me
fit in more.
Sha-qwill O'Neal character.
All my getting ahead of it
for nothing?
Well, at least I knew for sure
I helped sue.
And now
your 2010 cross-country team!
Let's hear it!
Yep, sue was happy
'cause I'd gotten on top of it.
She'd worn her new
cross-country sweatshirt...
all week long.
Ah!
Oh, man!
Are they okay?
I don't know.
I thought we could do it, Mike.
I really tught
we could get ahead of it,
but everything just got
screwed up.
Yeah. I never thought
we could do it.
You didn't?
No. It's not possible.
You can't get ahead of it.
You try to plug one leak
and another one just pops up.
So what are you saying,
I should just quit trying?
Yes. Please.
That's exactly what I'm saying. Mike.
Look, you gave it a shot.
You had an idea.
And you'll want to remember,
I was mpletely supportive.
The thing is, Frankie,
There are people
that have it all together...
and everything works out,
but we're not those people.
We don't have
an inground pool life.
We have an aboveground life.
But it seems kinda lazy
to just give up.
Don't think of it as giving up.
Think of it as getting ahead
of the quiing.
Everybody gives up
by Christmas anyway.
Think of how far ahead we'll be...
of all those idiots
who are still trying.
The truth is, once I gave up,
it was a huge weight
off my shoulders.
Life got back to normal.
Oh, my God!
I've overslept!
Is anybody up?
Nobody, and the bus driver's honking.
Brick, go get everybody up.
Never mind. I'll do it.
Everybody get up!
Dude, no one set my alarm!
I was supposed to write a paper this morning!
Mike, run out to the bus and tell 'em to wait!
Mom, look, I
printed out the front page...
of the school web site. Look at it!
"Overheated student ruins pep rally." Oh, honey.
I know! I'm in the paper!
I'm "overheated student."
Everybody's gonna know me now. Mom, Ms.
rinsky needs parents to supervise the field trip.
Can't. Banned. Go!
Wait. You never packed uslu.
Shoot. Ohh!
Let 'em sit out in the sun...
before you try!
Awesome.
You know those other people,
the ones we're always trying
to be like... ...
I think maybe
if they looked in our windows...
and saw how good we have it,
they might actually envy us.
