Out here in the middle,
Halloween's huge-
The trick-or-treating,
the costumes.
But our favorite thing is the night
we all get together as a family
to carve pumpkins.
Why am I the only one
carving a pumpkin?
Why do we even do this anymore
if they don't appreciate it?
Same reason we keep
feeding 'em. Habit.
- I'm ready to carve.
- There ya go.
- At least somebody's in the-
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Okay! Why don't we trade?
You hold the marker,
And I'll take the giant knife.
Oh, mike, I forgot to tell ya,
I met the Norwoods,
The new neighbors down the block.
They invited us to drop by this weekend.
What for? They don't even know us.
Well, it's not just us. I guess some
other people are gonna be there.
What, like a party?
Uh, I don't know.
It's a get-together.
- Some people might call it a party.
- So what day is this party?
- I think it's Sunday?
- So it's a Halloween party.
- Yeah, I guess it is.
- Yeah. I'm not dressing up.
Mike, come on! We never get invited
To Halloween parties anymore.
It'll be fun.
It's ridiculous. A bunch
of grown-ups running around
telling each other
how cute they are.
Costumes on kids are cute.
Costumes on adults are
sad and a little creepy.
Okay. I'm ready to carve.
Ha ha! The junior
high got permission
to move the Halloween
dance to nighttime!
Sorry, brick. Guess you're
on your own this year.
Yes! Finally.
For years, sue had dragged
poor brick around
As part of her Halloween costume.
trick or treat! trick or treat.
trick or treat. trick or treat!
trick or treat!
(flatlrick or treat.
Well, excuse me for wanting
your childhood to be fun,
Unlike axl ever did for me.
Ohh, if I could
only go back in time
And right all the wrongs
I've ever done to you!
Well, what are your big
Halloween plans?
I bet they're not better than going
to a dance... At night.
F.Y. Your information,
we're going to
A totally rockin' haunted
house that darrin heard about.
It's run by people who work in a morgue, so
there's real blood and actual body parts.
They don't tweet us the
address till Halloween night,
'cause they have to
move it every year,
the cops'll show up
and shut it down.
Seriously! It's illegally gross.
That does sound rockin',
But who's gonna take brick
trick-or-treating now that
Dad and I have a very fun, keep your
mind open, costume party to go to?
- Just think about it.
- Yeah, I guess I could bring him if you want.
- You like sered fingers?
- Who doesn't?
You don't. Okay. Dad I will
take you trick-or-treating
Before we go to the party.
I'll get the aunts to come over
And hand out candy. They're old.
They like kids again.
Sue, guess what? I have a
date for the Halloween dance
What? I didn't know
it was a date dance.
Yeah. Now that it's at night,
everyone's going as couples. Oh.
But wait. Here's the best part.
Natalie heard from brian
who heard from stacey
That wylie janousek likes you.
Really? Wylie janousek?
Yep, and he's gonna
ask you to the dance,
And you're gonna get
your first kiss,
And it will be so romantic! oh,
my god! Aah!
wait. Who's wylie janousek again?
It doesn't matter. Aah!
Hey there. I picked you up a
little somethin' at the mall.
Oh, yeah?
Hmm.
Interesting choice.
Not sure if it's my color...
And I already have
so many fringy vests.
no.
Oh.
Come on! You'll make
such a cute hippie.
Wait. Does it make any sense when
you see it next to this?
fine. You don't want to be hippies.
I'll take it back and
get us something else.
Who do you want to be?
I want to be mike.
- How about bonnie and clyde?
- Or bonnie and mike.
Oh. Frankenstein and
bride of frankenstein.
Or mike and bride of mike.
You know, you're gonna
be pretty embarrassed
When you're the only
one not dressed up.
No, I don't think I will. Oh, fine.
Wear the same two boring
plaid shirts until you die.
That's the plan.
Sue, uh, hi.
Hi, Wylie.
Yeah. Listen. I don't know
if you've heard anything,
But people have been saying that,
you know, I like you.
Oh? I hadn't heard anything.
Well, it's jussorta out there,
and I just, you know,
I want you to know... I don't.
Oh. Oh, okay.
Thank you for clearing that up,
Even though I hadn't heard it.
You can't ever have
too much information.
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
You know that bus crash
yesterday on the interstate?
I heard they got there
before the paramedics
And swiped a couple of the bodies.
I heard no one's ever gotten
through without barfing.
Mrs. Heck, nice to see you.
I told michelle from algebra
about how gnarly it's gonna be,
and she wants to come.
Best part-she'll bring
some of her hottie friends.
Wait. Do we really want chicks there?
They'll get all scared.
Dude, think about it.
Girls get scared,
Throw up all over the place,
look to us for comfort. Boom!
We're making out with 'em.
Oh. Sweet!
Kissing's gross enough,
But wouldn't it be worse
after the girl just threw up?
Your brother prefers to learn
his lessons the hard way.
Well, change of plans.
Sue Heck won't be atending
Hallowing dance this year.
- Why? What happend?
- Funny story...
every one decided to go with dates,
which i think it's... fantastic.
Even better, there is this
boy who I heard likes me.
But he came to my locker just to
tell me that he doesn't like me.
Isn't that hilarious?
I didn't really
wan't to go, anyway.
I'll just stay home and end up
having candy with the aunts.
Yeah, three single ladies,
drowning our sorrows in candy.
Oh, honey.
Well, unless Brick wants to go
trick or thrething with me...
Hey, you know, there is
always the church team group.
I think there are doing a
Hallowing hayride this year.
- Oh yeah?
- Whenever there is a exiting event for kids,
The church always ofers an...
"alternative. "
three... Two... One...
Happy new year.
A holy hayride.
That could be really fun.
The new year's thing was...
Fun, so... Okay.
Thank you.
So Halloween finally arrived.
Sue was off to the hayride,
Axel was off to his body parts,
And the aunts were
prepped and ready.
Okay. One piece of candy per kid.
Watch out for grabbers and repeaters,
And I shouldn't have to say this,
But if you run out of candy,
You can't go giving out
cigarettes and pills.
We've been giving
out candy for years.
We'll be fine.
Hey, baby. Power to the people.
Ooh. Who's the square
in the plaid shirt?
Oh, right. It's that costume that always
sells out first every year... Mike.
- Hey, brick, let's go.
- I'm ready.
Wow, look at you...
All... Wearing a
skirt and everything.
Who you supposed to be?
He's shirley temple.
You don't recognize me?
From history?
Okay. I'll give you a hint.
I died from bayonet
wounds in the great war.
I'm sergeant charles mackenzie,
The scottish world war I hero.
look, I don't expect a
lot of adults to get it.
I don't think a lot of kids
are gonna get it either.
Hey. I thought you were
gonna get a date for me.
Are we picking her up later?
Oh. Yeah. Uh... Do you
have a date for my friend?
No. Sorry, dude. I tried.
Are you sure this is where
the directions said to go?
The tweet said to turn
left onto the dirt road
After the seventh barn.
But we passed, like, 100 barns.
Well, maybe if you were a better barn
counter, we wouldn't be lost right now.
trick or treat!
Oh, look. A princess
and a ghost and a...
Catholic school girl.
I am sergeant Charles
Stuart Mackenzie.
I died in France.
bayonet injury...
Is none of this ringing a bell?
Brick, just get the candy and move on!
They're not gonna get it!
You couldn't talk him into
superman or something?
Clearly I'm not good at talking
anybody into doing anything
they don't want to do.
Not when they don't want to look stupid.
'ello, 'ello, blokes.
- Anybody call for a chimney sweep?
- Jeez
Hi, bob! You look so cute.
you look so cute! Oh.
So you couldn't talk crabby
pants into the vest, huh?
Bob, aren't you a little old
to be trick-or-treating?
Oh, it's not for me.
I just donate all the candy to
the sick kids in the hospital.
Mm-hmm. Ohh. You got a little
chocolate on your face there.
Oh! Hey, listen, big man.
I just shotgunned three pixy stix.
you do not wanna mess with me!
See? Even bob dressed up.
I wouldn't count on winning any
argument that starts with "even bob. "
You know, I just don't
get you sometimes.
Halloween is a night of fantasy,
Of-of being somebody
you always wanted to be.
Haven't you ever just wanted to be
somebody else, just for one night?
Am I married or unmarried
in this scenario?
no, I'm serious.
Isn't there some dream,
some fantasy,
You know, something else
you hope for in life?
Not really. Nothing?
No. I'm content.
You're content? With this life?
- The one we're living right now?
- Yep.
Why?!
Meanwhile, sue was looking toward
A pretty dreary Halloween with
stodgy old reverend hayver
And the rest of the kids
with nothing to do.
- And then something amazing happened.
- Happy Halloween, sue heck.
Reverend Timtom.
You remembered my name...
After only meeting me two times
And then coming to
my family's barbecue.
That's amazing. But what are
you doing back in Orson?
- I thought you moved to Dayton.
- Aw, Sue.
I'm the roving rev. I go where
the teens need me the most.
The teens in orson need you, too.
I can be troubled.
I once took cough syrup even
though my cough was mostly over.
Oh, I'm never too far away.
I've either just been here,
or I'm on my way back through.
Well, sue heck, what do you
say we get this party started?
? plenty of ghosts on Halloween?
? some are nice,
and some are mean?
? I know a ghost
pleasant as can be?
? I ain't talkin' about
casper or jacob marley?
? sea to sea, coast to coast?
? he's the absolute most,
he's the holy ghost?
Halloween night was in full swing,
And it was nice to know that aunt Edie and
aunt Ginny were holding down the fort.
Hello?
Hey. It's groundskeeper
Willie from "The Simpsons. "
Does no one read
history on this block?
I'm thinking he might just wanna
go with groundskeeper willie.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up.
That is a lot of toilet
paper you got there.
Yeah. Yeah, uh, my mom
asked me to get it for her.
Oh, wow, what a nice kid you are,
Going shopping for
your mom on Halloween
Instead of running around pulling
pranks and causing trouble.
Um... I'm gonna call
the police right now
And recommend you for some
kind of plaque or somethin'.
What? Nothin'.
You wanna be a Halloween narc,
that's fine with me.
So I should've just let
'em T.P. some house,
So the poor family has to clean up 32
rolls of toilet paper in the morning?
Whatever.
Come on, brick.
well, don't just leave it there.
This is 3-ply.
This is coming with us.
I know that Halloween
can be kinda scary,
But you know what's even scarier?
Just being a teen in
this crazy world, huh?
But there's no judgment
in god's yearbook.
You're all voted
"most likely to dance. "
Grab a partner,
And let's get ready to rock.
Hey, Sue Heck. I could
use a tambourine player.
got it. I got it!
? dress like a devil?
? dress like a ghoul?
? jesus don't mind?
? he's pretty cool?
? dress like a playa,
dress like a ref?
? one year I dressed like gandhi
and collected for unicef?
? a-hey, hey, Halloween?
? well, it's Halloween,
and by the way?
? it's really all saints' day?
That's too fast, Sue Heck.
That's a little too slow.
Hey, you know what?
What do you say I just follow you?
Axl's plan to scare the
girls was working,
Especially now that
they were lost.
- I'm scared.
- Me, too.
If you're scared, come a little closer,
huh? I'm serious.
- This road reminds me of that story.
- What story?
it was, like, ten years ago.
There were these teenagers
in a car on their way up
to that abandoned
drive-in on route 4,
And they disappeared.
Then, like, years later,
A farmer was plowing his field,
And he found a shallow grave
With a bunch of chopped-up
teenagers in it.
But when they finally counted
up all the body parts,
There was an extra head...
With no body!
But they were okay, right?
No, darrin. No.
No.
Look, I'm not groundskeeper Willie,
Hannah Montana, a bagpiper,
Or anybody from "gossip girl. "
"gossip girl. "
Well, I don't know any
of those people,
But, to me, you look like
sergeant Charles Mackenzie.
You know who I am?
- The man's a legend.
- Mom, can I stay at Mr. Johnson's?
He knows who I am!
I'll walk him home later,
frankie. Okay.
the seaforth highlanders
- Would never leave a man behind.
- Aye. Indeed.
Oh, hey. Don't worry
about that tambourine.
You're a very enthusiastic player.
That's nothing to be down about.
I just thought this year
was gonna be the best ever,
'cause I'm on cross-country.
Did I tell you I'm
on cross-country?
Yeah. Yeah, I think you mentioned it
a couple times... during the song.
But I just feel like
I'm behind in...
everything.
Getting my braces off,
My first kiss...
I'm sorry. I don't want
to ruin your Halloween.
Maybe I should just skip
the hayride and go home.
So you're in a rough patch.
You know who ee hit a rough patch?
Jesus.
He was dead.
But then three days later,
he was back on his feet,
Rockin' it resurrection style.
My point is, you never know
what's right around the corner.
You know,
I think I will go on that hayride.
Thank you, reverend timtom.
You really do get teens.
whoo-hoo!
Great job, frankie!
Now save that. We're making
caramel apples later.
Wanna go next, mike?
Don't worry. He's doesn't.
Hey, I finally get it!
You're the brawny guy!
Oh, sorry. We're a hippie...
And mike.
I love this song! Dance with me.
? uh-huh?
uh-huh?
? uh-huh?
? ah, ah?
uh-huh?
? uh-huh?
uh-huh?
Come on!
Put your beer down and get into it.
? all right, ooh?
? doo-doo, doo-doo-doo,
doo-doo-doo?
? doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo?
? doo-doo-doo?
? doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo?
where are you? I see you in there!
candy, candy, candy!
give it now or else! We want candy!
It's-it's stuck in the mud.
We're gonna have to
get out and push.
I'm sure that guy who
killed those teens
Is probably gone by now.
All right. Ready?
oh! Kill it!
It's a bird, and it's
trying to fly in my hair!
Aah! Get it off of me!
Get it off me!
It's trying to fly in my hair!
Aah! Aah! Oh, my god!
Aah! Aah! Get it off me! No,
no, get it off me!
Oh. My bad.
We're good! We got this.
Totally under control.
Frankie.
Hey.
What's... what's going on?
Are you really mad?
What's going on?
What's going on is that
you wouldn't dance.
Everybody was dancing-
the smoking baby guy,
The screaming mel gibson guy,
both of the situations,
Oh, but not mike.
What are you talking about?
I was out on the dance floor.
Yeah, but you wouldn't dance.
You just stood there like a... Maypole
While I danced around you.
You looked ridiculous.
I looked ridiculous? What was this?
- I'm being a hippie!
- Please. That's your signature move.
You break it out at
every wedding we go to.
I- I don't get what's
happening, mike.
I don't get what's happened to you.
You used to dance
before we got married.
You really want to go down this
road of things we used to do
before marriage that
we don't do after?
I just thought that
for one Halloween,
we didn't have to do the same old thing...
Sitting on the couch,
Complaining about how kids
are gonna smash pumpkins.
I thought for once,
we could put on some fringy vests...
And just have fun, but, no,
you're not fun. You're mike.
I'm fun. We just have a different
definition of the word is all.
You think adults dressing up
And-and bobbing for
swine flu is fun,
and I'm right.
Aah! Why don't you get it?
I just want to have a good time.
Who's stopping you? Go! Have fun.
I wanna have fun with you, Mike!
You should be happy. 17 years.
I still want to have fun with you.
- Wh-what are you doing?
- Nothin'.
Just havin' fun.
mike! This is the donahues' yard.
They're our friends!
Yeah, I know. They're also sort of annoying.
That's what makes this fun.
Are you fun or not?
But they're home!
So we have to be quick.
- I'll get the tree. You get the bushes.
- Give me another one.
- All right.
- Oh! This is fantastic.
? anything can happen?
? you never know
what's gonna come?
? anything can happen?
? for anyone?
oh. Sorry.
At's, uh, that's a nice costume.
Do you, uh... Do you want to kiss?
Uh... Okay.
? see the stars at night?
***
? anything can happen?
Do you- do you want to go again?
Okay.
? on a night like this?
Halloween is a night of surprises,
all right.
Sue got her kiss...
Axl didn't...
Brick found someone who
understood him...
And mike and I...
Well, let's just say that we had
some honest to goodness fun...
Until the cops came.
We lost the heat.
? on a night like this?
well, it's late.
We need to be goin'.
Strange.
Not one trick-or-treater this year.
Well, no wonder.
It snowed.
Yep, I have to say,
Halloween this year turned out
to be prettyroovy.
I guess on the night of
the first snow,
Anything can happen. Aah!
