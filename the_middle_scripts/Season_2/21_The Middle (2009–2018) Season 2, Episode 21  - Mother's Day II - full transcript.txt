(crows caw)
(frankie) mother's day--
It's about more than brunch,
corsages, and cards.
It's about taking a moment
to make
That special woman in
your life feel extra special.
This Sunday is mother's day,
And I've got a real soft spot
when it comes to moms,
So, frances,
you're gonna need to work
So the boys here can spend
the day with theirs.
But, mr. Ehlert,
I'm an actual mother.
I can't work on mother's day.
Hey, maybe you'll get
a pity sale.
Just look a little more raggedy
than usual
And put on a sad face.
Yeah, that's the one.
Okay, back to work.
Don't worry, frankie.
I'll cover for you Sunday.
Really? Oh! Thank you!
Wait. Wait. But didn't you say
You and your mom were
doing a whole spa day thing?
Yeah, that was the plan,
But, uh, she's spending the day
with her new boyfriend,
And she hasn't exactly
told him about me yet.
How long have they been dating?
(voice breaks)
about a year.
I have to stop now.
I only scheduled legos
from 4:55 to 5:19,
Which leaves me
two minutes of transition time
Till my mom comes.
He's a little quirky.
(whispers) quirky.
(doorbell rings)
Hey, there's your mom.
Hey, that's your mom.
I know, arlo,
I'm a minute early.
Don't sweat it. He's ready
to go. Aren't you, pal?
Brick had fun.
Oh, would you mind
if the boys did this again
A week from Sunday?
Arlo is wide open.
Brick, too. Sounds good.
Great.
You could've asked me.
A lot of work, that kid.
A lot of work.
Oh, ho! Epic fail!
You munched it bad, darrin.
(chuckles) okay.
Yeah, I gotta dash.
Stew in your stupid, bro.
You blew it.
You will not believe
what a bonehead darrin is.
Oh, I might.
(mouth full) you don't text
a chick to ask her to prom
Before the 15th.
It's, like, an ironclad rule.
(cap thuds)
in my opinion, you don't "text
a chick" to ask her anything.
You talk to her face-to-face.
Yeah, well, I'm not
some dinosaur from the 1800s.
No offense.
Oh, none taken. So what's
so special about the 15th?
It's basic science.
Two weeks out,
You go after
your gold-circle hotties,
You know, your premium,
floor-level seats.
And if you land one, sweet.
But if you get shot down,
You lower your requirements
day after day
As the chicks' desperation grows
until they converge and bam!
You lock in your level somewhere
between front row and loge.
Now if you start too early,
You got no chance
at the floor seats.
You're stuck up in
the nosebleeds with some uggo.
(door opens and closes)
Mike,
you're not gonna believe it.
Mr. Ehlert wanted me
to work on Sunday.
This Sunday.
Mother's day?
Oh, I know. (scoffs) I was
just too stunned to respond.
What a jerk.
Sue, axl, brick,
get in here.
Oh! So that's why everybody was
making those pot holders.
I probably
should've done one.
How could we forget
mother's day again?
I count on you guys
to remember this stuff.
How was I supposed to know
It's even on a Sunday this year?
I'm not a calendar.
I feel horrible.
I just love mom so much.
She deserves
the best mother's day ever.
Yeah, well, that ship has
sailed. Now we got three days
To slap something together
that doesn't suck.
What does your mom like?
She likes driving us places.
And doing our laundry
and stuff.
And making us soup.
No, she doesn't.
Whose mom are you thinking of?
I'm talking about a present.
What present would she like?
Come on. This should be easy.
The woman has nothin'.
Wait. Last year,
I remember her saying
She wished everyone would just
leave her alone for the day.
I enjoyed that menopause book
I read on the airplane.
Hang on, brick.
Let's let sue finish.
Sue, she really said that?
I totally remember
her screaming it to grandma.
Hmm. You really think we could
pass that off as our present?
The gift of not us?
I like it.
So, listen, I wanna
float something by you.
Oh, no.
That thing from the magazine?
It's fun to think about,
but I don't think it'll work
With our height difference.
I disagree. But actually, I was
talking about mother's day.
Now the kids and I
have been talking about
What to get you for weeks now,
and we were wonderin'
How you would feel
if as your gift,
We just left you alone
for the day.
Yes. Oh, mike,
yes, I would love it.
I mean, not that I don't want
to be with you and the kids.
Oh, we know.
We wanna be with you, too.
But if they're excited
about the idea...
They are pretty excited.
Well, if they're excited,
then I guess we should do it.
She went for it. All you guys
gotta do is make her a card,
And we're home free.
(axl, brick, and sue)
a card? Ohh!
So mother's day was here,
And I woke up to a sound I'd
never heard before--silence.
(birds chirping in distance)
Mike? Axl? Brick? Sue?
I didn't know
what to do first--read...
Sleep...
Watch "oprah"...
Ooh, maybe I'd even go
to the bathroom
Without someone pounding
on the door.
Damn it. Don't have to go.
Since I accidentally borrowed
a few "people" magazines
From my last dentist visit,
I decided to read.
And then I remembered
something--I'm blind.
But when I went to
the junk drawer for my glasses,
Stupid thing was stuck.
But you know what?
Not a problem.
I had a whole free day
ahead of me,
And I'd been wanting to fix
that drawer for weeks.
An hour later, I was done.
Now I just had to put
the giant screwdriver
Back where it belonged,
And the rest of the day
was mine.
Oh, there's that flashlight.
(sighs)
So I decided to go through
the batteries because you gotta
Have a flashlight in the house
with batteries.
But when I went to put it
in mike's nightstand,
It was stuck, too.
And then I found something
you never want
To find
in your husband's nightstand,
Something I couldn't ignore--
An unpaid gas bill.
(sighs)
Billing! Billing! I pressed "4."
I want to talk to a human.
Human!
(sighs)
And then
after defrosting the freezer
And scotchgarding
the winter shoes,
I don't even know
how I ended up here.
Crap.
(water swishes)
(gasps) oh, no!
It can't be 7:45!
This can't be happening.
I blew my whole mother's day.
Mmm!
(door opens)
We're home!
Hey, there she is,
reading on the couch.
So did you have
a great mother's day?
(mouth full) so great.
How was your day?
I'll let the kids tell you.
Guys?
Oh! It was so good!
Oh. It was amazing!
So awesome, mom.
We had so much fun!
Okay, slow down.
One at a time.
We wound up
going to brown county.
You went to brown county?
I love brown county!
I didn't know you were
planning on going there.
No, we weren't. You know, we
were just kinda driving around,
And we realized
we were halfway there,
So we figured, what the hell?
There was this fair
with all these rides
And a huge ferris wheel.
It was awesome!
I was a little scared at first,
but then axl tickled me,
And I forgot all about it!
She had the funniest laugh,
so then we all started laughing,
And then the whole--the whole
ferris wheel's lauhing.
And then we had a picnic lunch.
Of course you did.
Mom, you should've been there.
We had rhubarb lemonade
And pretzel-crusted
fried chicken.
(gasps) and these tiny cakes
baked in a jell-o mold.
And we met this amazing family
named the clarys...
The clarys.
And they had these kids
that were exactly our age,
And we ended up playing
volleyball with them.
Net face.
(brick) net face!
Net face! What's net face?
Whenever we needed a point,
dad would stick his face
In the net and go,
"net face. Net face."
And the clarys
would crack up,
And they couldn't make
the point.
You're so funny, dad.
Stop.
You stop.
Why don't you both stop?
Oh, hey, almost forgot--
we got somethin' for you.
Oh!
You got me one
of those old-timey photos
That I've always wanted
to take as a family,
But nobody's ever had
the patience to do it.
Yep. Now you'll always
remember this mother's day.
I sure will.
You know, it's funny, I've never
been a good gift giver,
But I gotta tell ya, I really
think we nailed this one.
Yep.
Play your cards right,
I might even leave you alone
on christmas.
(crying)
Hey. Whoa.
What's going on?
What's this?
Wh-what's happening?
I had
a horrible mother's day!
What are you talking about?
You said you had a great day.
I lied.
I couldn't find my glasses,
And I shoved the spatula
in the stuck drawer,
And the freezer
was all crusty,
And I just frittered away
the whole day.
The whole day!
And you guys had the best day
ever in brown county!
Oh, no, no.
It wasn't that great.
It was--it was hot,
and it was crowded
'cause there were
so many moms there.
(sobs)
No, that's not what I meant.
Uh, we didn't have fun
Because we all missed you.
Oh, please!
Look at this picture.
You have never been happier.
It's as if you had
the mother's day
You would've had
if I were dead!
No, frankie, stop it.
You know what? We can have
another mother's day, okay?
Yeah, next year.
No. No, next weekend. We can
all go back to brown county
And we can do it all again
with you. How's that sound?
Think you might stop crying
if we did that?
I think I might.
Mom screwed up
her mother's day,
So next Sunday
we're doing it again.
(axl, brick, and sue groan)
Mother'soing on over there?
Day can't start without us.
Let's hit the road.
Axl, quit messing with the phone
And get in the car.
Shh. It's the 15th.
I'm texting my number one
prom draft pick--maddie heldman.
Here it goes. "you, me, prom.
Answer in 30 minutes,
Or I move on."
I'm glad we're doing a redo.
Last week I forgot my money,
So I couldn't buy anything
at the gift shop.
But this week I've got $17
in my change purse,
And I plan
on spending $13 of it.
Oh, fun! See, this is the way
mother's day should be.
I mean, how often do we get to
do things with just our family?
Hi. Arlo's here
for his playdate.
Oh, yeah. No, we're kinda doing
a family thing today.
Oh, no. He's already put it
in his datebook.
If you change it,
he could really flip out.
(metal clanks)
Aw. What happened
to the fair?
Sorry, folks.
It's all coming down.
It was just special last week
for mother's day.
Hey,
who needs rides anyway?
Spending time with my family
is all that matters.
I have to go
to the bathroom.
(sighs) brick,
you wanna take arlo...
(arlo) mrs. Heck,
are you still here?
Yes, arlo, I'm still here.
I've been here for 15 minutes.
Can you put your foot under
the door so I believe you?
This isn't happening!
I'm supposed to get a text
back from maddie about prom,
And I got no bars.
I've been all over this place,
From the candle shop,
all the way
To the other candle shop.
No bars. (exhales deeply)
Okay, let's get
this party started, huh?
Arlo, you can let go now.
So... What should we do first?
Well, last week we had a picnic
lunch, and they give you
These big blankets
to spread out in the park.
Oh, that sounds perfect.
And I heard all about that
pretzel-crusted fried chicken.
And the cake baked in jell-o.
I would eat your shoe
if it was baked in jell-o.
You got it.
Axl, put your phone away.
Sue, decide already.
It's your mom's special day.
We're having a picnic.
Whoo!
I'd like to purchase this
indiana cow creamer, please.
Wait a minute.
Pine cone earrings
with a matching necklace!
(gasps) aah!
I'm sorry.
We aren't serving food today.
That was just special last week
for mother's day.
(coin clinks)
okay, we got a choice between...
Ham and cheese,
turkey and cheese,
And cheese and cheese.
Frankie, it's your special day,
so you get first dibs.
Mrs. Heck, I have allergies.
Of course you do.
I'm allergic to wheat,
gluten, dairy, and cats.
Well, thank you, arlo,
but I don't think
You're gonna be eating
any cat sandwiches.
Or maybe you will.
Okay, I just got the best gift
from the gift shop.
It's a plaque that says--
are you ready?
Nurses call the shots.
Get it? Shots?
'cause nurses give people shots.
Maybe it's only funny if you're
a nurse, which I am not.
I'll be right back.
(tools whirring)
This is fun.
Yeah, this is fun.
Okay, arlo, buddy, you're
sitting a little close there.
How about giving me
a few inches here, huh?
So... What else
did you guys do last week?
Uh, well, we, um,
played volleyball.
Well, bring it on!
Net face. Net face.
(tools whirring, hammering)
Axl, get over here.
We're gonna play volleyball.
Oh, my god! I still can't
get service 'cause I'm stuck
In this backwoods,
hillbilly tourist trap.
Not a tourist trap.
It's a cultural center.
How cool is this hat? I mean,
I love drinking beverages,
But it's such a hassle
holding the cups,
And now I don't have to.
I'll go back
and get something else.
No. No one's going anywhere
until we play volleyball.
Mrs. Heck?
(sighs)
Okay, we're back.
Who wants to be on my team?
Arlo, you're on brick's side.
Ugh!
All this stupid redo stuff?
You know, my last birthday
kinda sucked. Do I get a redo?
How about sue?
She's had a crappy 14 years.
Does she get a redo?
Hey!
But the clary family isn't even
here. They're what made it fun.
We don't need the clarys
to have fun. We got hecks.
Okay, you ready?
I got a killer serve.
(sighs)
Who's up for an old-timey photo?
Are you sure you can't find
a cute cancan girl costume?
I've always wanted
to be a cancan girl,
You know, with the feather
and maybe a bottle of hooch?
They're already put away.
Look, I'm doing you a favor.
I'm supposed to be closed
already.
Sue, axl, brick, let's go!
Are you sure this time?
Positive. Can you imagine
How cool I'll be at school
with this giant pencil?
Everyone will be like, "there's
the girl with the giant pencil."
I love it.
How you gonna sharpen it?
(sighs)
Come on, sue!
The photographer has to leave!
Arlo, stop yanking my chain.
Where's brick?
I don't know.
He was here a second ago.
(sighs)
Brick! I'll look.
Wait. A signal.
I got it. (chuckles)
I lost it. (groans)
Lady, I really gotta go.
How about I just take one
of you and your son?
He's not my s--oh, screw it.
Just take the picture.
(camera shutter clicks)
Brick,
you're supposed to be inside.
I needed a break from arlo.
You know, it was
an interesting experiment,
But I don't need a friend.
I did it. I finally got
the perfect souvenir.
What does octopus have to do
with brown county?
Duh. His hat says
"I heart brown county."
Plus, I just love the ocean
so much.
Hey, there she is.
I found everybody, and we're
ready to take that picture.
It's over mike. We already
took it, and it's something
Mother and son's friend
will treasure forever.
No, if you want the kids
to take a picture,
They're gonna take a picture,
even if I have to
Crack some heads to get it.
You know what? Forget it.
Let's just give up and go home.
Yes!
No way.
Why not? It's what she wants.
Excuse me.
Ferris wheel's still up.
How about you let us
take quick ride?
What? Sorry. No can do.
(sighs) listen,
this is for my wife.
She screwed up her mother's day,
this is a redo,
And nothing's going right.
But you got a ferris wheel,
and she loves ferris wheels.
This could turn
the whole thing around for me.
I'll give you 10 bucks.
Happy mother's day, ma'am.
You got five minutes.
Whoo-hoo! Yay!
Yay! We're riding
on the ferris wheel!
(axl) let's do this
so I can go home.
Mrs. Heck?
Okay, we're back.
Brick, are you sure
you don't wanna ride with arlo?
Sorry. Love to,
but I'm already in!
(frankie) whoo-hoo!
Wow! Isn't this great?
Isn't this fun, kids?
(axl) it is now!
I'm getting a signal!
I've got bars!
Wow. You can see for miles.
Oh, I bet it wasn't
this pretty last week.
Isn't this wonderful?
(sue gasps) octie!
(ferris wheel creaks)
Can you please be careful
with octie?
I think I might want
to return him
For a chicken head oven mitt.
The text. I finally got
the text. Ha ha!
Yes! She said yes! I'm going
to the prom with ashley.
(laughs)
wait. Who's ashley?
Oh!
God, I texted
the wrong number.
Thanks for the crappy phone with
the small buttons, mom and dad!
(groans)
(sighs)
Well, this sucks.
I thought it would be hard to
top last week's mother's day,
But I think we've done it.
Well, I'm sorry mother's day
was so miserable for you.
Mike, I'm not blaming you.
Really? 'cause it sounds
like you are.
No, no.
It's not your fault.
Maybe sneaking off
to brown county last week
Wasn'the greatest idea,
but--
I didn't sneak off.
Well, you didn't tell me.
You said y wanted
to be left alone.
I didn't think you cared
where we were going.
Oh, come on.
You know I have always wanted
to come to brown county.
Have you ever wanted
to come to brown county?
Not that I can remember.
Well, you're here now
D clearly having
the time of your life.
Well,
we got kids in the gift shop,
Axl on his cell phone, and...
So I bring you to brown county.
You're not happy.
I gave you the day to yourself.
You're not happy.
You know, I worked
really hard to give you
The mother's day you wanted.
Oh, pfft!
What's a "pfft"?
You didn't work that hard.
You don't think I heard you
three days before mother's day?
"sue, brick, axl, get in here."
and then you left me alone
For mother's day.
How hard was that?
That's what you wanted!
It's not what I wanted.
That's what you said
you wanted!
I didn't know what I wanted!
I thought it'd be fun!
It wasn't fun!
I can't believe this. When I got
the kids home last weekend,
I thought you'd thank me.
For what? For sucking down
jell-o cakes with the clarys
While I had my arm
shoved in the toilet?!
You know, next father's day,
how about I take the kids out
And leave you home alone
all day? Huh? How about that?
Great.
Oh, yeah, you know what?
You would just love that.
It's just so easy being a man.
Not right now it isn't.
I don't know what more I
could' done for you, frankie.
I gave youwo mother's days.
Crappy ones.
Okay, you know what, frankie?
And then mike said something
You shouldn't say to any woman
on any day,
Especially
her second mother's day.
You know what? That's it.
I'm outta here.
(seat belt clicks)
Where you gonna go?
We're stuck.
No, you're stuck.
(sighs)
(thud)
Little farther down than
you thought, huh, frankie?
Come on. Let's get you
to the couch.
Do you think arlo
ever heard that word before?
'cause he acted like
he never heard that word.
You should've said it earlier,
dad.
Sure made him quiet in the car.
Yeah, but the point is,
I should never
have said that to your mom,
No matter how many mother's days
she made me give her.
Okay. Here we go.
Magazines.
Remote.
Peach pie from neptune's grill.
Happy mother's day.
(kisses)
I'm sorry, mike.
I know I was acting crazy.
It's just that sometimes
as a mom, you know, you--
When you're with your kids,
you wanna be alone,
And then when you're alone,
you wanna be with them.
When and it's likeour kids,
no matter where you are,
You feel guilty that you're not
in the other place, you know?
No.
No?
I don't feel guilt
that way... Ever.
Sorry.
Jeez. Fathers
shouldn'even get a day.
No guilt. That must be nice.
It really is.
Okay, kids, let's vamoose
and let your mom relax in peace.
Okay. Good night, mom.
Love you.
Good night, mom. Love you.
Wait, wait, wait.
Where you going?
It's still mother's day.
I wannbe with you guys,
Okay.
Ooh.
(exhales deeply)
Yonk!
You know what? Not this close.
I just want to see you guys.
Maybe you could go over therea?
(brick) yeah.
Uh-huh.
(mike)
um, us three against axl.
(brick speaks indistinctly)
(mike) yes.
Perfect.
Now this is the mother's day
I wanted.
