[ Crow caws ]
Frankie:
Out here in the middle,
we spend a lot of time
at the movies.
We go to escape the heat,
the cold, and just
the monotony of our lives.
Yep, everybody loves
going to the movies.
I've never been
to the movies.
What are
you talking about?
Of course you've been
to the movies.
No, I haven't.
I've seen them on TV
and from the car once,
but I've never been
in an actual theater.
[ Sighs ]
Oh, yeah, I remember.
We wanted to take you
when you were little,
but you had all
that sensory weirdness.
Yes, and I'm sure
that's how
the doctors suggested
you refer to it.
Very healthy,
very supportive.
I'm a teenager and I've never
been to the movies.
It's pretty sad.
When I was a teenager,
my mom died.
Yeah, but she took you to the
movies before she did, right?
We're taking you now.
Here, put these
Milk Dudes up your sleeve.
What are Milk Dudes?
The Frugal Hoosier version
of Milk Duds.
What are Milk Duds?
You know
what Milk Duds are.
It's a classic
movie sna-- Oh.
I got potatoes
for everybody.
Are potatoes
a classic movie snack, too?
He says we've never taken him
to the movies.
Oh, well, "Flatlands" is a great
first movie to see.
It was partially filmed
right here in Orson.
A Hollywood movie partially
filmed in Orson.
They used Tally's Diner as what
they call an establishing shot.
I read that
in the "Orson Patch."
It's not actually the inside
of the diner.
The third unit just came
and shot the exterior.
What?
I drove by.
So, what goes on
at the theater?
Are there chairs?
Is there a conveyor belt
that brings you in?
As I mentioned,
I've never been to the movies.
Have you been to Earth?
Not if I have to rely on you
to take me there.
Snap!
Slap it high!
Shove those
down your pants.
Roger that.
This is so cool.
I know.
I didn't sleep last night.
I am running
on pure adrenaline.
Oh, you know,
they sent in what they call
a third unit
to shoot the exterior.
Mike drove by.
Hey, Mom!
They have popcorn here!
We didn't have to bring
our own!
[ Chuckles ]
You'd think he'd
never been to the movies.
He has.
[ Laughter ]
I was so bummed that the actors
didn't come to Orson to film.
I've never seen a celebrity.
Bill's met one
at a pool.
Tell them, Bill.
Oh, Okay.
Yeah, I mean,
it was somebody big,
but let me
just get you there.
I'm in college,
a busboy,
and they say there's gonna be
a group of 12 coming.
So,
you got your sections.
Oh,
when I was a waitress,
I could never get
the section I wanted.
I don't know why.
Oh, no, no. I do know why.
There was this one waiter,
and he knew the owner.
No, no.
It was his nephew, Brian.
Ugh, hated that guy.
[ Chuckles ]
So -- So, I didn't know
who it was, right,
but I knew it was a biggie
because they had to have
exactly five sliced lemons
in their water.
I mean, you don't get that
unless you're somebody.
What is with the lemons
in the water?
I do not get
why that is fancy.
You get the seeds
in your throat.
It's not quenching.
-[ Chuckles ]
So, anyway, you're bringing
the guy lemons...
Yeah, only I didn't say
it was a guy.
[ All "Ooh" ]
Oh!
So, I'm there with the lemons,
door opens --
Was it Heather Locklear?
I only say that 'cause I read
once that she visited Missouri.
-[ Sighs ]
-I like her. She seems real.
Frankie, let the man
finish his story.
[ Both chuckle awkwardly ]
Yeah,
it was Heather Locklear.
She loves lemons.
Hey, Judi!
Exciting, huh?
-Who's that?
-None of your business.
Want some pop, honey?
-I'll take a pop.
It's right down there
by your gigantic feet.
Hey, Fredelle!
Oh!
What's this?
You told us
to save you seats.
Yeah, not with you.
Ugh, fine.
Where are
my Milk Dudes?
Oh, here, Sean.
I got you a potato, too.
Thanks.
There's no meat on here, right?
It's just a phase.
Uh, where are the forks?
Oh, well, I forgot them,
and they didn't have
any at the concession stand,
so I just took these.
Hold them down low.
I didn't buy anything
when I took them,
so they're essentially
stolen.
You can take straws.
They figure that in.
-In what?
-In their thing.
What thing? I cannot eat
a potato with a straw!
It's got a tiny spoon
at the end of it.
It's a spoon-straw.
It's a spraw.
[ Sucking loudly ]
Well, so far, movie food
is not impressing me.
Oh, my God.
Can this family never
just buy something
from a concession stand?!
It's all good, man.
We're all
just trying our best
to make our way
through this life.
Nobody wants to hear
your liberal jibber-jabber.
Frankie:
Okay, you know what?
These are just dry,
that's all.
Sue, go back to the concession
stand and get some butter.
No, I already stole
once today.
They figure that in.
I don't know what
that means!
Sue, just go.
I don't want
to miss Tally's Diner.
You'll be fine. We still have
to sit through all the previews.
[ Action music playing ]
Man: Coming, Summer 2016.
Based on the best-selling
series that swept the nation...
[ Music stops ]
Man #2: Silligans.
David S. Rosenthal's...
"Planet Nowhere."
They're doing a movie
about "Planet Nowhere!"
Hugh Jackman
as Professor Faxon.
Ray Liotta
is Gackos the Batossian.
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson
is Soran.
And introducing
Montana Steinberg
as Princess Kalakare.
[ Lasers blasting ] Kalakare:
The Vernegos will prevail.
Princess Kalakare's
132 years old!
That kid's
not a day over 11!
They can't do this!
You can't do this!
Brick, it's not like the couch.
You got to sit down.
[ Action music continues ] Stop the movie!
Stop the movie!
[ Indistinct conversations ]
[ Register beeping ]
Oh, this is for the popcorn
my mom bought before the movie.
Uh, uh, she's very
generic-looking,
so you definitely
saw someone
who looks like her
buying popcorn.
And she did.
With a credit card.
Not a credit card.
Y-You'd have a record
of that.
She used cash.
She carries a lot of it.
Please don't rob us.
[ Laughs nervously ]
I don't think
you're a robber.
Ah!
-Ugh.
-Sue?
♪♪
Logan!
Hi!
Hey.
How's -- Oh!
I mean, what we just saw
isn't "Planet Nowhere."
Man: Based on an
incredible true story.
The sets are cheap. The
Kalakarians look like Silligans.
And Hugh Jackman?
He can't pull off this material.
He's
a song-and-dance man.
I'm sick.
I'm just sick over this.
That could be
the potatoes.
Who are these
Warner brothers?
Is there one
who's like the leader,
so if I get to him,
the others will fall in line?
'Cause I need them
to not release this movie.
Brick, once the previews come
out, it's done. It's too late.
Did Professor Faxon give up
when he was negotiating
with the Zorgonauts
for the Malakian Canal?
He didn't.
But I can understand
your confusion,
'cause Hugh Jackman
would fold like a Klugarg.
That's Malakian
for card table.
I have to stop this.
Coming soon in digital 3D.
Maybe keeping him away from the
movies wasn't the worst idea.
[ Scoffs ]
Hey, you've been acting weird.
What's with you?
Why don't you guess?
Oh, no.
I don't like this game.
All right,
then, I'll tell you.
You embarrassed me
in front of our friends.
"Let the man
finish his story."
Opening Labor Day weekend...
Oh, Frankie, come on.
I was trying to help you.
-What?
You kept
interrupting Bill,
and it was getting
uncomfortable.
So,
I'm working at this resort,
and they say there's this
big group coming in, right?
You've got your sections --
-Ohh!
When I was a waitress, I never
got the section I wanted!
I have no idea why!
Well, anyway --
Oh, no. I know why!
There was this one waiter,
the owner's nephew.
Brian!
Ugh, I hated that guy!
So, I didn't know who it --
-Who it is.
-But I knew it was somebody --
-Big. Yeah, for sure.
Because they wanted
five sliced lemons
in their water
because you never --
-Okay, what is it...
-[ Groans ]
...with people and lemons
in the water?
Why do people like that?
You get the seeds
in your throat.
Am I right?
Who's with me?
Yeah, so, anyway,
you were getting lemons...
So, I'm, uh, getting the lemons,
and in comes --
Was it Heather Locklear?
I bet
it was Heather Locklear
'cause I read that she visited
Missouri one time.
I like her.
She's so real.
I think we would be friends.
I really do.
Honey, let the man
finish his story, okay?
Okay, first of all,
you've never called me "honey"
in your life.
And I wasn't
interrupting him.
What I was doing is something
called making conversation.
You wouldn't recognize it
because you never say
anything to anyone.
You just stand there like
a plaid Abe Lincoln statue.
I'm telling you,
it was uncomfortable.
The only time
it got uncomfortable
was when
you snapped my head off.
What are you
talking about?
They were horrified.
You couldn't see
their faces 'cause
you're so freakishly tall,
but I saw their faces.
So,
I'm working at this resort,
and they say there's
this big group coming in, right?
You got your sections.
When I was a waitress, I never
got the section I wanted.
Exactly! We had this one
waiter, the owner's nephew.
Brian!
I hated that guy.
Oh, man, we had a Brian!
No!
[ Laughter ]
So, I don't know
who's coming in, okay,
but I knew
it was somebody special
because they had to have
exactly five sliced lemons
in their water.
What is it with the lemons
in the water?
I do not get why
that's fancy.
You get seeds in your throat.
It's not quenching.
[ Laughter ]
So, you're bringing
the guy lemons.
[ Clears throat ]
Yeah.
Yeah, only -- only I didn't say
it was a guy.
[ All "Ooh" ]
Ohh.
So I got the lemons,
the door opens,
and guess who it was.
Mm...
Was it Heather Locklear?
'Cause I think I read
an article where she --
Pbht!
Let the man finish his story!
[ Sighs ]
I didn't go like this.
I went like this.
Oh [scoffs]
it doesn't matter.
Either way,
it was disrespectful to me.
When we go out
in the world,
we present a picture
of a loving, happy marriage.
We do? Yeah, and you took that
picture and you just smashed it
between your long,
Crypt Keeper fingers.
Give me a break.
Every couple gets annoyed
with each other.
In private.
You did it in public.
You let everyone in.
There's now six people
in our marriage.
Good, can I pick another one
to hang out with?
[ Sighs ]
[ Cheers and applause ]
Yeah!
Oh, I feel like I have to pee,
but it's just excitement!
[ Chuckles ]
I don't want to argue here,
all right?
I want
to enjoy the third-unit
establishing shot
of Tally's Diner.
We'll talk about this at home.
-We're not done?
Woman: And you say
that's in my tap water?
-Check it out.
-Hmm?
That kid's going in
for a kiss.
Ooh, gutsy move
right at the beginning.
If she shoots him down,
that's a long movie.
Yeah, but if she doesn't,
that's two hours of kissing.
High risk, high reward.
-[ Gasps ]
-Yeah!
And he scores.
Nice.
Man, I remember
my first kiss.
Oh, yeah.
Totally memorable.
I mean, all of mine
are memorable for the girl.
But that first one --
Susie Baker's basement.
-Me too.
-Yeah?
[ Both chuckle ]
Helped it was super dark.
-Yeah.
Wouldn't have had
the nerve otherwise.
Yeah, I did it in that closet
behind Susie's furnace,
where it's super dark.
-Me too.
[ Chuckles nervously ]
And so, we kissed
for a f-few seconds,
and then Susie's dad
came downstairs,
and yelled,
"Everybody out!
I want to watch
'Deal Or No Deal!'"
Yes. So we ran like crazy,
and she -- she hit her head.
And I hit my head.
So then I found Brick,
but when I got back
to the library,
you were gone.
Oh,
when I couldn't find you,
I thought maybe
you were blowing me off.
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't blow off.
That's not my sty...uhl.
Style.
I tried to shorten "style"
and it came out "sty."
-Uh-huh.
-You were there for that.
Uh-huh.
[ Laughs ]
So, uh --
So I guess that means
we actually want
to spend time together.
I guess it does.
I'm sorry.
Uh, you're missing the movie.
What's a movie?
Oh!
Oh, right.
Oh, no.
I don't care about that.
I'm only here
because my parents made me.
Let me just get
them this butter.
Just stay...right here.
Yes, yes.
Actually, you know,
maybe we should just
exchange info this time,
just to be safe.
Smart.
[ Phone squeaks, clatters ]
Butter.
[ Chuckles ]
-Hey.
-Hey.
Pretty boring, huh?
Who'd have thought a movie
about unsafe drinking water
in the Midwest
wouldn't be a thrill ride?
[ Chuckling ] Yeah.
Hey, Ron,
let me ask you something --
Do you think I was too hard
on Frankie earlier?
-What do you mean?
-In the lobby.
When she kept
interrupting Bill,
and I told her
to let him finish.
Oh, I didn't notice
anything.
Thank you.
'Cause she's saying
it's a big deal,
and now we're supposed
to talk about it at home.
Uh-oh.
If I were you, I'd just
apologize and end it here.
Never take a fight
to a second location.
Huh.
All right,
I'm heading back in.
I don't want to miss
the big lab scene
where they
test the dirt.
Yeah.
Ketchup or no ketchup?
Ketchup,
unless it's a hot dog.
-Me too.
-Yeah!
Um, which Jimmy --
Fallon or Kimmel?
Kimmel.
Mm, 100%.
-Ice skating or sledding?
-Sledding.
-Me too.
-Yeah.
-Weak ankles.
-[ Chuckles ]
Jacket or no jacket?
-What?
-It's kind of cold out.
Do you want my jacket?
Oh.
Ohhh.
[ Chuckles ]
-Jacket.
-Yeah?
There we go.
[ Both chuckle ]
Woman: I'm meeting my lawyer
for lunch.
Oh, she just said she's gonna
meet the lawyer for lunch.
This could be the diner!
-Oh!
They aren't telling us
what is really...
I've gotten a lot better
at it.
What?
[ Clears throat ]
-The kissing.
-Me too.
Way better.
Just so you know,
I've kissed 38 women
and I've never had
any complaints.
Me neither --
no complaints.
I'm still in single digits,
but then my grades are better.

We use a charcoal filter.
We change it every month.

Hey, it's the diner!
[ Applause ]
Oh, I've had pancakes there!

At home.
[ Sighs ]
We can't stop everyone
from seeing "Planet Nowhere,"
but even if this one theater
didn't show it,
it would
make a difference.
I hear you.
I got to sit through
that preview five times a day.
Nine galaxies, and the only
black guy is Dwayne Johnson.
So we agree.
All you have to do is
lock the door.
If you don't turn it on,
no one will see it.
I got to show it.
It's my job.
Don't sweat it, man.
Think about
all the other movies
that are different
from the book.
I wouldn't know.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Oh, this looks good.
Totally gonna see it
opening day.
Frankie: Brick realized
he needed to take a stand.
So he took the stand.

I'm thinking about
changing my major.
Oh.
Well,
I don't really think
that's gonna affect
our relationship.
Unless, I mean,
if it's psychology,
because I think
I'm gonna do psychology.
And if we have two
psychologists in the family,
then that could
really mess up our kids.
-Uh...
-Not that we're having kids yet.
It's not like I've already named
one of them Emmaline.
