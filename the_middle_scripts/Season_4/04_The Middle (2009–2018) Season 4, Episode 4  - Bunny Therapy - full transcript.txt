Out here in the
Middle, cheerleaders and
football players have been
dating since the
dawn of time.
They go together like jell-o
and fruit cocktail,
cheese and crackers,
mayo and...
well, everything.
Oh, hi.
What are you guys doing here?
- And you are...
- Sue.
Axl's sister.
I don't think so.
No, no. I'm pretty sure
he doesn't have a sister.
He doesn't have a sister,
right, Court?
No, he has a brother, though.
He's cute.
You should meet him...
I have met him, because he's
my brother, as is Axl.
One sec.
Why are you talking to them?
They don't know
I'm your sister.
And I'm working very hard
to keep it that way.
They're cheerleaders,
and you're...
whatever this is.
Now leave.
You're Sue-ing up the place.
No.
This is my house, too, Axl, and
I can go wherever I want.
Oh, my god.
It's my senior year, and I just
started dating a hot blonde
cheerleader, and now Sue's out
There saying she knows me.
So?
What do you want me
to do about it?
Oh, I don't know.
How about a little parenting?
Like locking her in the
basement, or sending her to
some bible camp to pray
the dork away!
Look, it's enough that I
said I'd stay in here while
your friends are over.
I'm not gonna make
Sue do it, too.
One of us is gonna be out there.
Pick one.
Me or Sue?
Forget it.
We're going to a movie.
Axl, you should know,
there's a sad girl who's lost
in your house.
Oh, hey, mom, I wanted to
talk to you about what I'm gonna
try out for this fall.
Uh-huh?
I was thinking I shouldn't
try out for anything.
Maybe I should just save myself
for wrestlerettes.
Oh, thank god...
that you're gonna be spending
more time with us.
Yay!
But don't worry. I am not
just going to squander my time.
I am going to use it to try
to learn a cartwheel.
Okay.
Well, I have good news
and bad news.
It's never good news-good news, is it?
Never here.
Sue has decided not to try out
for anything this fall.
Hey. She's finally given up.
That is good news.
The bad news is,
I got an e-mail
from Ms. Tompkins,
Brick's social skills teacher?
I guess she wants
to meet with us.
Again?
When is that woman
gonna realize
she's underpaid, and check out?
- What is it this time?
- Could be anything.
Although, you know what,
when I think about it,
lately, he hasn't been
that bad.
When's the last time
he whispered?
Three weeks, right?
Wait. Maybe she's
calling us in to tell us
he's moving up
to the yellow group.
Hey. Good news-good news.
High five.
Mm!
So... I'm guessing you know
why you're here.
We think we have
a pretty good idea.
Right. It's about Brick's tic.
Yep. Three weeks.
I know. That's why
I'm so concerned.
You're concerned he hasn't
whispered in three weeks?
Oh, no. I'm not talking
about the whispering,
I'm talking about the new tic.
I'm sure you two have noticed.
Whoop.
Whoop.
I don't think we've ever
changed the batteries.
Whoop.
So no yellow group, then?
Oh, God, no.
See, with the new tic,
Brick's issues have moved
out of my area of expertise,
so I'm wondering how you'd feel
if I looped in my colleague,
the school therapist.
A therapist?
- Oh, I don't know about--
- Fortunately,
Dr. Fulton just happened
to be free this period.
Hi. Chuck Fulton.
Oh, wow. She said your name,
and here you are,
almost as if
you'd been waiting.
- Frankie Heck.
- Hi.
- Mike Heck.
- Hi.
Hey, guys,
I've taken the opportunity
over this past week
to observe your Brick
in the classroom,
and I concur that
he shows some reluctance
in engaging with his peers.
They'll try to talk to him,
and he just sort of
wanders away.
Ever talk to kids his age?
Not that interesting.
- Mike.
- And the whooping.
Yeah, that...
That's a fresh one,
even for me.
Now he could be whooping
for any number of reasons.
I mean, it could be the sign
of a serious mental illness...
or something simple.
We just don't know.
But my gut is telling me
that what we're dealing with
here is an attachment disorder.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're elevating his quirk
to a disorder now?
No worries, mom and dad.
We've got a lot of weapons
in our arsenal
to try and treat this.
Drugs? You wanna put him
on drugs?
Whoa!
Easy, mom.
We're not allowed
to go there first anymore.
No, I think we can start Brick
with something as simple
as a pet.
A pet?
Oh, no. He kills pets.
Oh.
But not on purpose.
Mostly accidental.
- Oh.
- It's neglect, really.
And he feels bad.
I mean, he doesn't cry.
Not like a serial killer.
I know they don't cry, either.
They don't have any empathy
for their victims.
Like Brick, but he--
Okay. That's noted.
The basic idea is that he learns
to bond with the pet,
and then he learns
to bond with people.
It's all part of
a multipronged approach.
Sounds expensive.
How many prongs we talking here?
Well, we were thinking
to supplement the great work
that Laura's doing here
with some biweekly sessions
with me.
I could conduct the sessions
on the playground,
over a game of hacky sack.
Look, I appreciate
everyone's concerns,
but we're not the kind of family
that needs therapy.
Quick. Close the door.
The most amazing thing
happened today.
The mascot
for the Thundering Hens
got juvenile shingles,
so now they're holding tryouts
for a new mascot!
Ha ha!
Well, it just goes to show ya,
sometimes when God
shuts a door,
he opens a window.
And sometimes God just wants you
to do nothing for a while.
I have to practice everything
with this box on my head
until it all seems normal.
Yes! Thank you!
Finally made Sue
wear a box on her head.
I've been pushing this
for years!
Shut up, Axl!
Whoop.
You don't think Brick
needs a therapist, do you?
I mean, sure, we didn't jump
on the whispering thing
right away,
but I think we can get out
in front of this one.
It's only his second tic.
You're forgetting
the ketchup packets.
Ketchup packets
were a phase, not a tic.
Nobody help me.
I need to learn
to get up on my own.
So... we hanging out
after school?
Can you do after school, Court?
I can do after school.
We'll be there.
Every time I try
to get Courtney alone,
Debbie is always there.
Wait. I thought
you were dating Debbie.
What?
No, I'm dating Courtney.
Uh, I don't think so.
Why would you say that?
'Cause everybody at school
thinks you're dating Debbie.
Well, then, everybody
at school is wrong.
Are you sure?
Yeah, Darrin.
I think I know who I'm dating.
It's Courtney.
Man,
it doesn't get much better than this.
Chillin' out,
watching "The Avengers,"
dating the hottest girl
in school.
Oh, that's sweet.
Isn't that sweet, Court?
So sweet.
Isn't he the best?
He is. I don't think there's
ever been a better boyfriend.
Never a better boyfriend.
I have no idea who I'm dating.
What do you mean, you don't
know who you're dating?
I don't know, okay?
They were both acting
like they were dating me.
It was weird.
Who'd you ask out?
That would at least
eliminate one.
I thought I called Courtney,
but maybe I called
Debbie instead.
I just don't know anymore!
Come on. We can
figure this out.
Which one
seems to like you better?
I can't tell 'cause they're
always together.
I mean, I assume
I'd go for the blonde,
but Debbie's really been
riding me lately,
so maybe she's my girlfriend.
Which one have you been
making out with?
Oh... my... God.
Three weeks, you haven't
even kissed one?
Maybe you're dating Darrin.
He could do worse.
I'm kind, and I always
show up on time.
I haven't been making out yet
'cause I'm never alone
with whoever it is I'm dating!
Ugh! Man, I gotta
figure this out.
Homecoming's this weekend.
I can't afford
to take both of them.
Look, just ask
the right questions,
and the answer
will reveal itself.
Huh.
All right.
So after agreeing we were
smarter than a therapist,
Mike and I went about
fixing Brick's tic
in the way
only loving parents can do.
Whoop.
Knock it off.
Whoop.
Whoop.
Whoop.
Whoop.
Stop it!
Stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it, stop it!
Look, Brick,
we got you a bunny.
Why?
Oh, no reason.
Whoop.
Oh... my... God.
You got us a bunny?!
Aah! I can't believe it!
Whoo!
- What are you doing?
- I'm practicing.
As a mascot, I have to
exaggerate all of my movements.
I just love him so much.
I thought we were
getting something smaller.
We were, but they were
out of gerbils,
and I didn't want to go back.
Sue, get away from the bunny.
It's Brick's bunny.
How come Brick gets a bunny?
Because he's the youngest,
and there are things
you got that he didn't,
and now we've even.
No, she can have it.
Thank you so much, Brick.
Oh! He is so cute!
I just love him so, so much!
I'm gonna name him "Bugs."
No, you're not
naming it "Bugs."
It's Brick's bunny.
He's gonna name him.
"Bugs" is fine.
Look! Look!
They got Brick a bunny.
What? How come he gets
a bunny and I don't?
'Cause Brick
needs help and you don't,
so Brick gets a bunny!
Oh, so he does
weird stuff and gets things?
I can do weird stuff.
Ooh! Aah! Blah-huh-hoo! Ow!
Now get me a car.
So the next day,
Axl put his plan into action.
So, who am I dropping off
first?
You can just drop us both
at my house.
We're having a sleepover.
Of course you are.
Well, I guess if everyone's here
for the mascot tryouts,
we'll get started.
Put on the head.
Oh!
There are those moments
in life when the stars align
and everything just
falls into place.
And with nobody else
trying out,
this was one
of those moments...
Ah! Ha ha ha!
If only Sue weren't Sue.
Attention, students--
because of low turnout, we are
extending mascot tryouts.
Anyone is welcome.
Anyone. Anyone at all.
Seriously. Anyone.
Brick, what are you doing?
You're supposed to be
bonding with your bunny.
There's something
wrong with it.
I think it has issues.
Whoop.
Come on. There's nothing
wrong with him.
He's a sweet, soft,
cuddly bunny.
He wasn't.
At first, we thought the bunny
was just scared of us.
Now look, Brick,
you just gotta learn
how to handle it.
Now you don't wanna
startle him.
Aah! Son of a--
Whoop.
And then we thought maybe
he was just hungry.
Well, we know
he doesn't like pop tarts,
but he certainly has a taste
for human flesh.
It wasn't long
before we realized
the bunny wasn't scared of us.
We were scared of him.
I am expecting
a super important phone call,
so nobody use the phone.
Because if nobody shows up
to try out by 5:00,
I am the new
Thundering Hen! Aah!
Oh, my God, it's out.
It's out of its cage!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Aah!
All right! All right!
Everybody stay calm!
I'll take care of this.
Brick, why is the bunny loose?
It was your responsibility!
I think you just answered
your own question.
- I see it!
- Aah!
Aah!
- Aah!
- There he goes!
Sucker's fast!
Oh, my God!
Oh, no! That's for me!
That's the mascot call!
Axl, go over there and throw
me the phone!
No way! I'm a football player!
I need my legs!
Wha-- ugh!
I see him! Right there!
Right there! Right there!
Ooh! Ha!
Got him cornered! Give me
something to pick him up with!
Here, here, here, here, here.
Damn it! Stay still,
you little rodent!
Dad, a rabbit
is technically a mammal.
Not now, Brick.
- Aah! Get it! Get it!
- What do you think I'm trying to do?
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Aah! Don't hang up!
Aah! Ugh!
Hello?
Okay, that's it.
That's it right there.
Just grab it!
Just grab it!
You wanna do this?
I got it!
I'm the Thundering Hen!
I got him!
I got the little bastard.
Oh, yay.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow
ow, ow, ow, ow!
If you'd have just gotten
a goldfish,
he'd be dead already.
Hey.
So I was thinking,
homecoming dance might be
more fun if we double dated.
Oh, wow, that would be fun.
Wouldn't it, Deb?
Totally. Sounds good
to me, Court.
Sweet. Now you wouldn't happen
to know of anyone
who might wanna go
with my friend?
He is really cool.
I might know
a certain cheerleader...
who would love to go with him.
Sarah, we found you a date!
You're going to
the homecoming dance with Sarah.
Bottom-of-the-pyramid
Sarah?
Had to be done.
Just another casualty
in this crazy game I'm playing.
Once the bunny
was in the bathroom,
he stayed there.
Kind of like Mike on a Sunday.
Occupied.
Okay. This is enough.
I need to know that
I can go into my bathroom
without hot cheerleaders
being in there.
Yes, I'm that old.
Bugs has gotta go.
We can't. The stupid thing
has gotta bond with Brick.
Brick barely bonded with me.
He's not bonding
with psycho bunny.
Dr. Fulton says if he can
learn to relate to the bunny,
he can learn
to relate to people.
Why are we making him do this?
What's so great about people?
Because Brick needs
to learn how to attach.
Why? All he wants to do
is read.
- That's not true. Brick wants to feel a
part of things. - Brick wants to whoop,
read a book, and be left alone.
I'm his mom. I think
I know what Brick wants.
How do you know what Brick
wants? Have you ever asked him?
No.
No, I have not. Wow.
We never talk to Brick
about... anything.
Maybe we should talk to him.
Maybe we should.
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?
He gets another tic?
It's not like
we'd notice it, anyway.
Yeah.
Attention all students--
will Axl Heck's girlfriend
please report
to the main office.
ASAP...
or sooner.
I got your message, Axl.
A crow outside my window said
you would contact me today.
Are we going to homecoming?
- No!
- Okay.
See you at prom.
So, Brick, as parents,
your dad and I often talk
about what's best for you.
But we realize we don't always
include you in these talks.
I appreciate your candor.
I think I'm mature enough
to be involved.
Whoop.
So I'm just gonna
lay it out for you.
Here goes.
I don't think it's a secret
that you are unique,
and we want you to stay unique.
But not so unique
that you get labeled
as... too unique.
I think what we're trying
to figure out is,
why do you think you have
trouble connecting with people?
Hmm. That's
an interesting question.
Well, I don't know.
Could be 'cause you brought home
the wrong baby
and I was nursed
by a strange woman.
I mean, that might leave a scar.
Well, Brick, you were a baby.
- There's no way you could remember that.
- Yeah.
Yeah. Uh-huh. That's true.
Well, maybe it's 'cause you guys
don't really spend
any time with me.
We're... busy.
And yet not too busy
to watch Dance Moms.
Well, Brick, we're spending
time with you now,
and you're still whooping,
so...
I don't know.
There's just so many things.
We never really have
any nutritious meals.
That could be it.
We don't have set bedtimes.
Kids need structure.
We beg for stuff, and you cave.
That doesn't
establish boundaries.
Look, the point is,
you do enough weird stuff.
You don't need another one.
Knock off the whooping.
The whooping?
That's what this is about?
I thought it was about
the other thing.
The whispering?
No. I have to say
the pledge of allegiance
20 times before I go to bed.
Pledge of allegiance.
Awesome.
Sue had finally
achieved her dream
of becoming a Thundering Hen.
And to say she was excited
was an understatement.
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Aah!
...give it up
for your Thundering Hens!
- Hey!
- Hey! There she is!
Aah!
Ohh!
Oh, God, I can't look.
Did she get up?
Yep, she popped right up.
- All right. There you go.
- That's the spirit. - All right!
Wow! Good job, Sue!
It's 4th and goal
with 3 seconds left
on the clock.
The Hens gotta go
for the touchdown to win!
This was it. The final play.
You could hear a pin drop.
Until...
Whoop.
Hey, you guys
wanna shut your kid up?
He's been doing that
the whole game. It's annoying.
Whoop!
What? That's how we cheer.
It's just a family thing.
It's not weird. Whoop!
Whoop!
Whoop!
Whoop!
- Whoop!
- Whoop, whoop!
Whoop!
- Whoop!
- Whoop, whoop!
Whoop!
Hike!
And...
he's in there!
Axl Heck has scored
the winning touchdown!
The Hens have
pulled off a squeaker!
What a great game!
There you go.
It was a great moment for Axl
and an even greater moment
for Sue.
Yeah!
The only difference was,
everybody knew who Axl was
and what he had done,
but they didn't know
who Sue was.
Aah!
She was like a superhero.
When she was in plainclothes,
she was just Sue.
But when she was
in the mascot suit,
she could do anything.
Yep, so far, homecoming
had been a big success.
But Axl still had
a little unfinished business.
Okay. Here's the corsage
right here.
So come and get it... you.
A wrist corsage?
Oh. We don't wear those.
We don't. They leave
marks on your wrists.
- He's so sweet, though.
- Isn't he?
Well?
Man, you still don't know?
You better hurry. We're about
to leave for the dance.
That's it. I'm just
going for it and picking one.
I got a 60/40 chance, so, uh...
Courtney!
Axl!
Ow.
Uh...
Debbie!
Ooh.
What?
That was totally inappropriate.
Totally.
Hold on. Why are you mad?
'Cause you're
my girlfriend's best friend,
or because you're my girlfriend,
and I kissed you inappropriately
in front of your best friend?
Wait! Don't go!
One of you
is really important to me!
So the bunny didn't exactly
fix Brick,
but it did bring us
closer together
in a way we never expected.
The thing is, life is messy,
but you gotta keep trying.
Look, I'm just really into you,
and I think it'd be awesome
to get back together.
Or go out for the first time.
Hello?
Hello?
It's a multipronged approach.
